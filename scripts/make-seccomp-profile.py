"""Derive uf-seccomp.json from Docker's own default seccomp profile.

The commented `security_opt` line in docker-compose.yml needs a profile that
lets bubblewrap create a user namespace. Docker's default profile does not: the
whole namespace-and-mount family is allowed only for a container that holds
CAP_SYS_ADMIN, and this one deliberately holds none, so `unshare` fails with
EPERM before the kernel is ever asked (measured in the shipped container —
`proposals/implemented - Sandboxing/10-validation.md`: plain `unshare -U`, which needs no
capability at all, fails the same way, `Seccomp: 2` with one filter loaded, and
the kernel's own `max_user_namespaces` is 31734).

So the profile ships *derived* rather than hand-written, and derived from the
engine's own default rather than from a copy of it kept here. A hand-maintained
allow-list ages in the one direction nobody notices: a base image whose libc
starts calling a syscall the snapshot never listed gets EPERM inside a tool
call, which is not a sentence anybody traces back to a security profile they
edited a year earlier. Regenerating against the tag matching your engine keeps
the other 30 rules exactly as Docker wrote them.

    python3 scripts/make-seccomp-profile.py                 # the pinned tag
    python3 scripts/make-seccomp-profile.py v28.5.2         # any moby tag

Nothing runs this automatically, and the file it writes is not in the image:
the profile is read by the Docker *daemon* on the host, not by anything inside
the container.

# where the read-only binds and the tmpfs denies actually live. `clone3` is here

# it fall back — with `clone` allowed for these flags there is no reason to keep

# `open_tree`/`move_mount`/`fs*`). They travel with `mount` in Docker's own
