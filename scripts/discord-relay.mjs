// Turn this app's one signed notification into a Discord message.
//
// `notify.ts` sends one generic body to one URL and will not grow a vendor
// branch — the reasoning is in its docblock and in `docs/agent/run-lifecycle.md`,
// and it is a security argument rather than a preference. The practical cost is
// that a Discord webhook URL cannot be used directly: Discord's incoming
// webhooks accept only their own shape, so the six-field body answers
// **400 `Cannot send an empty message` (code 50006)** and the notification is
// lost silently. Measured against a live webhook on 2026-08-24; a Discord-shaped
// control body to the same URL answered 204.
//
// This is the shaping layer, kept deliberately outside `src/` so that nothing
// the app builds or ships knows what Discord's body looks like. It verifies the
// HMAC, reshapes, and forwards. It is the smallest thing that closes the gap;
// Home Assistant (`docs/install.md`) remains the reference receiver for anyone
// who wants fan-out to more than one place.
//
// The two URLs are separate variables on purpose. `UF_WEBHOOK_URL` names
// *this relay* and stays free to point somewhere else entirely, while
// `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` names the channel this relay happens to forward to.
// Collapsing them would mean the app's target and the vendor's target could
// never differ, which is the coupling the split exists to prevent.
//
// **It runs inside the app's own container, started by `docker-entrypoint.sh`
// when `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is set**, listening on loopback so that nothing
// about it is on any network. That is one process for an operator to think
// about rather than two: the failure it replaces is a relay nobody remembered
// to start, which is silent at the sending end and at the receiving one.
//
// It is a separate *process* rather than a module for the reason at the top —
// the app must not link vendor code — and the entrypoint drops
// `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` from the environment once this has it, because
// `orchestrator.ts` builds an agent's environment as `{ ...process.env }` and
// this URL posts to a channel on possession alone.
//
// Nothing stops it running on a host instead; point `UF_WEBHOOK_URL` at
// `http://host.docker.internal:8787/uf` and start it by hand.
//
// Configuration, whether the entrypoint or a shell supplies it:
//   DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL      the channel to post to (required)
//   UF_WEBHOOK_SECRET        the same value the app signs with (required)
//   DISCORD_MENTION_USER_ID  who to ping, or no ping at all
//   RELAY_PORT, RELAY_BIND   default 8787 on 127.0.0.1
//
// Inside the container every one of those arrives through
// `docker-compose.yml`'s `environment:` block and nowhere else — there is no
// `env_file`, so a name this list gains and that block does not is a key an
// operator can write in `.env`, read back in this comment, and never give a
// value to. `deployment.test.ts` pins the two files against each other.
