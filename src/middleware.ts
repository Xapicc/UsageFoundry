/**
 * Shared-secret gate.
 *
 * This app holds Claude credentials and can execute an agent with write access
 * to mounted code, so it is not something to leave open on a LAN. Auth is on
 * whenever UF_AUTH_TOKEN is set; leaving it unset makes the server refuse to
 * boot unless UF_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=1 says the operator meant it, so an unset token
 * reaching this function is a state somebody chose and every page announces.
 *
 * Two credentials, and they are deliberately different things. The bearer
 * header is UF_AUTH_TOKEN itself — what a script presents. The cookie is a
 * signed session handle that is *not* the token and cannot be replayed as one,
 * which is the whole of what changed: it used to be a thirty-day plaintext copy
 * of the master secret sitting in a browser jar.
 *
 * The per-turn and per-run capabilities two of the exempted paths below take
 * are neither of those, which is why each of those is checked in its own route.
 * The read-only credential a third one takes is a third thing again, and is
 * what makes that exemption conditional on it existing at all.
 *
 * Runs in the edge runtime, so it reads process.env directly rather than
 * importing lib/config (which pulls in node:os / node:path).
