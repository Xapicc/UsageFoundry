/**
 * A durable line per mutating request: what was asked, of what, by whom, from
 * where.
 *
 * Nothing recorded an authenticated request anywhere in this app. With
 * twenty-five agents landing code in many repositories, a bad commit could not
 * be traced back to an authorisation, and a token used to create runs left
 * nothing that separated those runs from legitimate ones. `runs.origin` answers
 * *which gate*; this answers *which request*, including for the routes that
 * create nothing — a stop, a delete, a settings change, a branch purge.
 *
 * **What a line holds, exhaustively**: the method, the URL's `pathname`, the
 * response status, the id the request named or created, how the caller
 * authenticated, the first-hop source address, and how long it took.
 *
 * **What it must never hold, and why each one is named rather than assumed**:
 *
 *  - *The request body.* Every run's prompt goes through `POST /api/runs`, and
 *    `POST /api/login` carries the master token in its body. A body-logging
 *    line here would write the credential this app exists to protect into a
 *    table and onto stdout.
 *  - *The query string.* `pathname` is taken deliberately rather than the whole
 *    URL: a query string is where a credential ends up when somebody puts one
 *    there by mistake, and once it is here it is here for good.
 *  - *Cookies and the `authorization` header.* `actor` says **how** a caller
 *    authenticated — a session cookie, a bearer token, the chat's per-turn
 *    capability, or nothing at all — and never with what. That is the whole of
 *    what an audit needs: which credential class, not which secret.
 *  - *Anything read out of a response.* Only the `x-uf-subject` header a
 *    handler sets on purpose, which is an id.

/**
 * The second half of the trail: what a mutation *changed*, on the channel that
 * ordinary traffic cannot evict.
 *
 * `recordRequest` above is the trail of **requests**, and it is a 20,000-row
 * window trimmed on every insert. That is the right shape for what it holds and
 * the wrong shape for a credential: the line saying the OAuth credential every
 * billed child runs against was replaced is exactly the line that has to still
 * be there after twenty thousand ordinary presses, and it is the first to go.
 * `ops_events` is written at boot frequency and at operator-press frequency, so
 * a row put here outlives traffic that would have evicted it next door.
 *
 * **Both, not either**, on the routes behind the gate. The wrapper records that
 * a request happened *including when it was refused*, which is the line an audit
 * most wants and the one this cannot produce; this records what changed when
 * something did, which the wrapper cannot say because it never reads a body or a
 * response. A route that wrote only here would lose its refusals. One that wrote
 * only next door would lose the rotation.
 *
 * **Who, as far as this install has one.** There is a single credential and no
 * user model, so the honest answer is the credential *class* and the first hop —
 * the same two fields the request line carries, computed by the same two
 * functions, and for the same reason stated at the top of this file: an audit
 * needs to know which credential was used and must never record which secret.
 * Nothing here invents an identity that does not exist.
 *
 * **`detail` is named by the caller, field by field, and never read out of a
 * request.** `OpsFields` stops an object being serialised whole, and that is the
 * mechanical half; the rule is the other half. A body posted to
 * `/api/codex-auth/api-key` is an API key and a body posted to `/api/login` is
 * the master token, and either one placed in a `detail` would be written to
 * SQLite *and* to stdout by the same call.
 *
 * **Never call this from a path the edge gate exempts, on a branch that refuses.**
 * `ops_events` keeps 500 rows against `request_log`'s 20,000, so a refusal
 * recorded here is a *forty times sharper* version of the lever
 * `docs/agent/security.md` describes for `/api/mcp`: an anonymous caller who can
 * reach the port empties the durable trail in five hundred requests. `/api/logout`
 * is the one exempt path that calls this, and it calls it only after a revocation
 * has actually happened — see the comments there.
