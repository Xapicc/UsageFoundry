/**
 * The vault-lookup skill: a plugin directory this app generates per spawn and
 * hands to the child with `--plugin-dir`.
 *
 * ## Why it is not installed
 *
 * `plugins.ts` states the constraint at length and it applies here unchanged:
 * compose bind-mounts the operator's `~/.claude` into the container, the CLI's
 * registry records **absolute** paths, and whichever side installs last breaks
 * the other silently — a skip logged, exit 0, and every session afterwards
 * running with no skill, no error and entirely normal-looking output. So
 * nothing here writes into `~/.claude/skills`, and delivery is per spawn.
 *
 * Measured against the pinned CLI (2.1.226) rather than assumed: a directory
 * carrying `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, passed as
 * `--plugin-dir`, is loaded as a session-only plugin ("Loaded 1 skills from
 * plugin … default directory") and the skill reaches the model's skill list as
 * `<plugin>:<skill>`. The namespace is not cosmetic: the operator may have a
 * skill of the same name in `~/.claude/skills` — this container does — and the
 * prefix is what keeps the two apart instead of one silently shadowing the
 * other.
 *
 * ## Why it is generated rather than shipped as a file
 *
 * The skill has to name the vault's absolute path *as the child will see it*,
 * and that path is a setting. The two candidate mechanisms were a generated
 * SKILL.md and a fixed one reading an environment variable, and generation wins
 * on three counts. The path lands in the file as literal text, so the agent can
 * `Read` it without a shell round trip and an operator can `cat` the file to see
 * exactly what a run was told. Whether the vault has a ranked search script is a
 * property of *that* vault, discoverable only by looking, so a fixed file would
 * have to carry both branches and hope the model picked the right one. And the
 * text is a template string in this module rather than an asset on disk, so it
 * is in git, reviewable, unit-testable as a pure function, and cannot go missing
 * from a standalone build.
 *
 * **`DATA_DIR` is the one place it must not be written.** The image creates
 * `/data` `chown root:root` + `chmod 0700` and the entrypoint re-reclaims it on
 * every boot, precisely so agents dropped to `UF_AGENT_UID` cannot read this
 * app's database; the same entrypoint names it in the CLI's managed
 * `permissions.deny` read list. A plugin directory there is unreadable by the
 * child on exactly the hardened install this feature is for — and the CLI's
 * response to a plugin directory it cannot read is a skip and exit 0. It would
 * work on a laptop and be silently absent in production, which is the failure
 * this whole area exists to avoid.
 *
 * ## Its own settings row
 *
 * `plugins.ts`'s reason, unchanged: the settings page sends the whole object on
 * Save, so a field in that blob is one that an unrelated edit from a stale tab
 * silently clears. For a preference that is a nuisance; for the switch deciding
 * whether unattended agents are told a vault exists it is the failure the
 * separation exists to prevent.

description: Search the knowledge vault at ${v.vaultLabel} — the operator's own graded notes — instead of answering from general knowledge.

---

Answer from the vault, not from memory. If the vault does not cover the
question, say so: an absence is a correct answer, and general knowledge relayed
as a finding is the one failure this skill exists to prevent.

## Check before you investigate

**Searching costs less than rediscovering.** Measured on this install, two runs
asked the same question about a recurring sandbox failure, differing only in
whether they were told to search the vault first:

| | Investigated from scratch | Searched the vault first |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | \$1.63 | **\$0.75** |
| Wall time | 369s | **83s** |
| Tool calls | 52, of which 24 errored | **15, of which 2 errored** |

The unsteered run also reached a confident conclusion from 19 observations that
contradicted a 9,269-observation measurement already recorded in the vault. So
this is not only about answering questions put to you: **before you start
digging into a failure, a flaky command or anything about how this machine
behaves, search first.** If the vault has it, you are done in a minute. If it
does not, you have lost one search and you now know the ground is fresh.

## The vault

\`\`\`
${v.vaultPath}
\`\`\`

List that directory before anything else.

**If it fails, stop and report it.** Say that the vault could not be read at
that path, quote the error, and answer nothing from memory in its place. Do not
go looking for the vault somewhere else, and do not carry on without it: a run
that answers as though it consulted the vault when it could not is worse than a
run that fails, because nothing downstream can tell the two apart.

## Search

${search}

3. **Read whole notes, never grep fragments.** A hit inside a \`> [!warning]\`
   block often says the opposite of the note's own claim.

4. **Follow \`[[wikilinks]]\` by resolving them yourself** — a link is a note
   title, not a path, so find the file whose name or \`aliases\` matches it.
   Skip \`\`\`dataview\`\`\` blocks; they render to nothing when read as text.

## Report trust, not just content

Every claim you relay carries its grade. This is the point of a graded vault;
stripping the grade makes the answer worse than no answer.

| Marker in the note's frontmatter | What to say |
|---|---|
| \`confidence: high\` | State it plainly |
| \`confidence: medium\` | Attribute it — "the vault's note, resting on a vendor report, says…" |
| \`confidence: low\` | Flag as unsettled; give the framing, not a conclusion |
| \`status: seed\` | A hypothesis with research steps, not a finding. Never cite as established |
| \`evidence: vendor\` | Name the commercial interest |
| a contradiction tag | Report both sides and what would settle it |

Keep the note's own distinctions: \`> [!quote]\` is a source, \`> [!note]\` is the
author's inference, \`> [!warning]\` is uncertainty. Do not flatten them into
"the vault says".

## What to return

1. **The answer**, with each claim's confidence and the vault-relative path of
   the note it came from.
2. **What the vault does not cover**, if the question ran past its edges.
3. **Any open question** the vault records on the subject — often more useful
   than the answer, because it says what is genuinely undecided.

## Never write to the vault

**Do not create, edit, move or delete anything under the vault path** — not a
note, not an inbox entry, not a typo you noticed on the way past. This skill is
a reader. If the work turns up something the vault should record, say so in your
answer and leave the writing to somebody whose job it is.

There is exactly one job in this app that writes here, and it is not this one:
a nightly pass whose *task* is to record failures that have recurred, which is
told so in its own prompt and is pointed at the vault as its working directory.
If that is not what you were asked to do, you are the reader. And if you were —
your task text governs, not this section.
