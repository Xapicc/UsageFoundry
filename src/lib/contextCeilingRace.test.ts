/**
 * The ceiling tick's two silences: a cycle ended while it was deciding, and a
 * crossing it decided *not* to act on.
 *
 * Both are absences, which is why they share a file: what is pinned in each case
 * is that something is missing that should be — an interrupt that must not be
 * written, and a row that must.
 *
 * `checkContextCeilings` reads `interrupts` at the top of its loop and then
 * awaits twice — a transcript resolution, and `ceilingCut`, which is a winnow
 * subprocess bounded by `PRUNE_TIMEOUT_MS` at two minutes. Everything it does
 * after those awaits is about a cycle it believes is still running, and the
 * window is wide enough that a cycle ending inside it is ordinary rather than a
 * race anyone has to arrange.
 *
 * All three ways it goes wrong are silent, and which one happens depends only
 * on where `startRun` had got to: the post-cycle checkpoint refunds a work cycle
 * that actually completed and skips the `DONE`, refusal and exit-code tests, so
 * a finished run silently buys another billed cycle; past that checkpoint the
 * entry survives to the next pass, where `interruptOutcome` — which has no
 * `prune` case, deliberately — files a healthy run as `stopped`; and past
 * `startRun`'s outer `finally` the entry is left in a process-lifetime map that
 * only two lines ever delete, so the next Resume of that run settles `stopped`
 * having spawned nothing.
 *
 * So what is pinned is the absence of a write, which is why the control below is
 * half the test: a case that never reached the interrupt site at all would pass
 * the first assertion for the wrong reason and go on passing it for ever.
 *
 * It is its own file for `cycleDeadline.test.ts`'s reason — `DATA_DIR` and
 * `CLAUDE_HOME` are read into `config.ts` at load, and this needs a projects
 * tree of its own for `resolveSessionTranscript` to walk — and one of its own:
 * it replaces `ceilingCut` on the module `orchestrator.ts` calls it through,
 * which is `shutdown.test.ts`'s device and not something to leave standing in a
 * file other cases share.
