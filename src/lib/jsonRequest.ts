/**
 * One request to this app's own API, whose failures are values rather than
 * throws.
 *
 * `chatRequest` was extracted for this reason and for one page; the same defect
 * was in the branches page's three destructive controls and in the land card's
 * poll, so the mechanism lives here and `chatRequest` is a thin caller of it.
 * `fetch` rejects on a server restarting, a dropped connection, a proxy blip,
 * and a handler that calls it unguarded reports nothing at all: the rejection
 * escapes an `onClick` or a `void load()`, the `finally` re-enables the button,
 * and the page is left exactly as it was — which is what a press that did
 * nothing also looks like. Folding the failure into the result is what puts it
 * on the same branch as a refusal the server explained, the branch the caller
 * already renders.
 *
 * `status` is the split the callers need and the reason this is not just
 * `chatRequest` with a wider body type: `null` is nobody answered, a number is
 * somebody refused. A poll turns that into `pollFailureMessage(status, error)`
 * — the wording every page here already uses — and a mutating press turns it
 * into `actionFailureMessage` below.
 *
 * A 2xx whose body will not parse is reported as a failure too. The land card
 * read `await res.json()` unguarded, so such an answer threw out of a `void
 * load()` and left the previous snapshot on screen with nothing said.
 *
 * `error: null` means the response carried no message of its own. The caller
 * supplies that sentence, because that copy belongs beside the button that
 * failed.
 *
 * `body` is the parsed body of a non-2xx answer that had one, and it is kept
 * because one caller needs a field `error` does not carry: the health route
 * names a database it cannot write in `checks.databaseError` and leaves
 * `error` absent, and `readOnlyBanner` renders that sentence above every page.
 * A transport failure never got a body, and a body that will not parse leaves
 * the key absent rather than `null`, so the shape every other caller reads —
 * `status` and `error` — is unchanged.
