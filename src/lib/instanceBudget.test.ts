/**
 * Covers *when* the workflow-wide budget is evaluated, which no pure test can.
 *
 * `evaluateInstanceBudget` is unit-tested beside `evaluateBudget` and answers
 * correctly about any figure it is handed. What was wrong was that it was never
 * handed a figure that had moved: every call site was "before something
 * spends", and for the ordinary block — `maxIterations: 1`, which is what
 * `normalizePolicy` answers when a template says nothing — that is one check,
 * against a total of zero, before the block's only cycle. The pass that would
 * have seen that cycle's cost is refused by `evaluateBudget` on `iterations`
 * and `break`s out *ahead* of the instance check. So a graph of single-cycle
 * blocks released together compared its limit with zero N times and never
 * again, and `maxInstanceCostUSD` could not fire at all.
 *
 * The database is the subject for `haltedMembers.test.ts`'s reason: the guard's
 * input is a SUM across three tables and its output is a status column, so
 * every way of getting this wrong typechecks, throws nothing, and looks exactly
 * like a workflow that came in under its limit. The only evidence is the bill.
 *
 * Its own file, and `DATA_DIR`/`CLAUDE_HOME` set before the first import, for
 * the reason `haltedMembers.test.ts` says: `config.ts` reads both at module
 * load and `workflows.ts` pulls it in statically, so a file that imported
 * either at the top would already be bound to the repository's own `.data`
 * directory — which on a developer's machine is the real one. `CLAUDE_HOME`
 * matters here in particular, because the check reads a real snapshot and a
 * transcript scan of somebody's actual `~/.claude` is not a fixture.
