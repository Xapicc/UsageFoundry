/**
 * Covers the two pure readings in `sandbox.ts`, and only those.
 *
 * Both earn a test on the same grounds and both are asserted in **both**
 * directions, because each has two silent failure modes that point opposite
 * ways. The detector: miss a sandbox refusal and an operator is back to reading
 * a run that spent money and wrote nothing with no way to tell a policy from an
 * unproductive agent — the failure `seedReport` was written to end for seeding —
 * and match too eagerly and every ordinary permission error in every run is
 * filed as a policy decision, which is a signal that fires on everything. The
 * arrangement: a policy that is switched on and names nothing runs every command
 * unwrapped, and an unreadable policy file is not evidence of absence, so both
 * have to be distinguishable from a working sandbox and from a stock install.
 *
 * Most of the literals below were read out of the pinned CLI binary in
 * `proposals/implemented - Sandboxing/` and have never been executed. The `bwrap:` ones are
 * the exception and the reason the rest are worth having: they are copied out
 * of this install's own `run_events`, where a sandbox that could not start
 * produced 214 failed tool calls and no `sandbox` row at all. What this pins
 * either way is that the matcher is exactly as wide as the evidence, no wider.
