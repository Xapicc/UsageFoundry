 * view of the vault that disagrees with the first about what is in it.
 *
 * **`textFade` is 0.35, and the number was read off the screen rather than
 * reasoned to.** It is a threshold on the *zoom*, so what it means depends
 * entirely on the zoom a graph opens at, which is whatever `fitView` produces
 * and which nobody had measured. Against the mounted vault — 1,258 nodes and
 * 28,551 edges at these defaults, settling to a 4,900-square world extent — a
 * canvas 880–1,040 CSS px wide frames the whole vault at `k` 0.12 to 0.14, the
 * biggest hub's `This note` graph at depth 1 frames at 0.68, and a median
 * note's at 2.96.
 *
 * At the old 1.1, *every* one of those is under the threshold: the first paint
 * of the whole-vault view and of a large local graph were both unlabelled, and
 * stayed unlabelled until a reader zoomed to about a hundredth of the extent.
 *
 * The obvious repair — put the threshold just under the fitted `k` — was tried
 * at 0.1 and is **wrong**, which is the thing here that had to be seen rather
 * than calculated. `draw` labels every visible node once the fade is above
 * zero, with no per-node filter, so at the fitted zoom that is 1,258 titles at
 * a constant screen size inside 820px: a grey smear over the graph, which is
 * the complaint it was meant to answer made worse.
 *
 * 0.35 is what both ends want. The whole-vault view opens clean and stays clean
 * until a reader has zoomed about 2.5× in — deliberately going somewhere, at
 * which point a neighbourhood is legible — and a local graph is labelled at
 * first paint at either end of its size range. `LABEL_RAMP` fades the last
 * stretch in rather than switching it on.
 *
 * **None of this reaches anybody who has already been here.** The panel writes
 * every change to `localStorage`, so an operator with a stored entry keeps 1.1
 * until they press `Reset to defaults` or move `Label fade` themselves. A
 * default is what the *next* first look gets.
