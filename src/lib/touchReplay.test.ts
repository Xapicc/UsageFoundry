/**
 * What the playhead is standing on, which is the only thing here an eye reads.
 *
 * Every one of these fails silently and draws a plausible replay of something
 * that did not happen. A step placed on the wrong node walks an operator through
 * a run that read files in an order it never read them in. A step placed on
 * nothing — which is what a touch behind a fold gets without `placeTouches`'
 * ancestor walk — makes the mark disappear for as many frames as that file was
 * read, and reads as the run pausing rather than as a directory the map rolled
 * up. A frame that dims at rest replaces the map instead of riding over it, and
 * the resting map is what this page was before the replay existed. And a
 * `changedNotTouched` file counted as reached at position 0 would say the branch
 * changed it *because* the run touched it, which is the reconciliation asserting
 * the thing it exists to check.
 *
 * The control is deliberately not tested. `touchedMap.test.ts` states the same
 * exemption for the canvas and it holds here: a rAF loop has no clock in this
 * runner, and an assertion over a button's disabled attribute would restate the
 * component rather than check it.
