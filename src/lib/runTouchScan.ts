 * against a file list the Changes tab has already fetched, and a client
 * component that imported this module would pull `node:fs` in behind it.
 *
 * **Not derived from the page's event array.** That array is the newest 2,000
 * events inside 4 MB (`stream/route.ts`), so a client-side derivation would
 * silently describe the tail of a long run as the whole of it — which is the
 * failure this feature exists to make visible, arriving in the feature itself.

/**
 * One row per file-naming tool call, relativised and ordered, as a subquery.
 *
 * Written once and read by both scans, because the `CASE` is the part that is
 * wrong in a way nothing reports: it is `readCountsFor`'s, and keying on
 * `repo_root` instead of `COALESCE(work_dir, folder)` then `folder` returns an
 * empty result for every worktree-isolated run and looks exactly like a working
 * query. A second copy of it here would be a second thing to get right, and the
 * one that drifted would be the one nobody read.
 *
 * One index range scan either way: `idx_run_events_run(run_id, id)` leads on
 * `run_id`, so scoping to a run turns the fleet-wide full scan `readCountsFor`
 * pays into a range. There is no index on `kind` and this does not add one —
 * that trade is decided in `fileCostNotice.ts` and it is about the write side,
 * which a reader does not reopen.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from that query. It is **not** filtered to `Read`,
 * since a write is half of what a reconciliation is for. And it **keeps** the
 * rows the `CASE` would otherwise drop at its `ELSE NULL`: a path matching
 * neither column is a touch outside the checkout, which is a group of its own
 * and the one thing nothing in this app has ever shown.
 *
 * `id` is carried out of the subquery because it is the only thing that orders
 * the rows: `run_events.id` is `AUTOINCREMENT` and so ascending in emit order,
 * where `ts` is a millisecond clock several calls can share.

/**

 * Files tab, which is polled open on every run page and draws one row per file;
 * shipping it a row per *call* would multiply that payload by however many times
 * a file was read, for a figure the table renders as a single number. So the
 * order rides on its own route, read only by the map at `/runs/[id]/touched`.
 *
 * **Ordered by `e.id` and never by `ts`.** `id` is `AUTOINCREMENT`, so ascending
 * `id` is emit order; `ts` is a millisecond clock and a burst of tool calls
 * inside one millisecond would come back in whatever order the query planner
 * felt like — a replay that draws a plausible sequence that did not happen.
 *
 * **Nothing here says a call succeeded**, which is `runTouches.ts`' rule and is
 * sharper on this surface than on the table: a playhead moving file to file
 * reads as progress. `orchestrator.ts` records a tool call when it is made and a
 * result only when it *failed*, and the failure row carries no `tool_use` id
 * joining it back — so there is no field to add and no join to invent. The
 * sequence is what the run *attempted*, in order.
 *
 * Server-only for this module's own reason: the surface that draws it is a
 * `"use client"` file, so the derivation over these rows lives in
