/**
 * The two halves of the install-wide control, and both are database subjects.
 *
 * **The stop** has to take down every live run in one pass, whatever status each
 * is in, and it has to block the ones that have not started *before* it signals
 * anything — because stopping a run releases its dependents, and a dependent
 * released a moment before the walk reached it would be admitted, promoted and
 * spawned. A run starting *because* the fleet was stopped is the failure this
 * ordering exists to have none of, and nothing about it throws: the operator
 * gets a page saying everything stopped and an agent working underneath it.
 *
 * **The hold** is read by four separate call sites — `promoteQueued`,
 * `releaseDependents`, `tickSchedules` and `emitBlockRuns` — and a fix that
 * misses one is silent in exactly the same way: work starts while a banner says
 * new work is held. So there is a case per site, each driving the real entry
 * point rather than the pure decision underneath it, and each proving the
 * *difference* the flag makes by running the same call with it clear.
 *
 * Its own file, and `DATA_DIR` set before the first import, for the reason
 * `haltedMembers.test.ts` gives: `config.ts` reads that variable at module load
 * and `orchestrator.ts` pulls it in statically, so a file importing either at
 * the top would already be bound to the repository's own `.data` — which on a
 * developer's machine is the real one.
