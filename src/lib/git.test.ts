/**
 * Covers what every git call this app makes carries, and only that.
 *
 * Both halves fail silently. A missing `-c` is a repository-controlled command
 * executed by this server's own git child — a `post-checkout` fired by the
 * `worktree add` of a run that did not write it, or a `post-merge` fired inside
 * the operator's live checkout — with no permission mode, no tool lists and no
 * line in `run_events` to say it happened. And a variable that survives the
 * scrub is that command handed this app's configuration: `DATA_DIR` is the
 * address of the database `serverLock.ts` exists to protect, and a run that
 * closes out every other run's rows looks exactly like a container restart.
 *
 * Nothing here can observe the agent's own git, which keeps its hooks
 * deliberately — that spawn is `buildArgs`, and it passes no config at all.

/**

 * Every caller of `git()` in `land.ts` reads a `GitResult` and none of them has
 * a `catch`, so this is load-bearing rather than defensive — and the way it was
 * wrong is invisible from the call site, because `spawn` demotes only five
 * errnos to the `error` event this already handled. `ENOTDIR` is the one that
 * can be provoked deterministically; the one that matters in production is
 * `EMFILE`, which does not throw from `spawn` at all but *returns* having
 * skipped the stdio wiring, so `child.stdout` is undefined and `setEncoding`
 * throws instead. Both arrive at the same line, and both used to reject.
 *
 * What that cost is a merge queue row: the rejection propagated out of the
 * worker's loop and left the branch it was landing stuck on `landing` for the
 * life of the container, with no status the operator could ever see change.
