 * How a `log` row is set, which is the one event kind whose text this app did

 * Every other row in the feed comes from a branch in this process, so what it
 * says is decided beside the code that decides it. A `log` row is whatever a
 * child wrote to stderr — a build, a compiler, or a plugin registered through
 * `--plugin-dir`, whose hooks' stderr is its only channel back to the operator.
 * Telling the last of those from the first two is a judgement made on the text
 * alone, and both directions of getting it wrong are silent: a plugin's report
 * buried in a build reads as noise, and a compiler's line wearing a plugin's
 * name says something ran that never did.
 *
 * No `DATA_DIR` dance ahead of the import, unlike `retention.test.ts` beside
 * it: `logLine.ts` is client-safe and reaches no module that binds a path.
