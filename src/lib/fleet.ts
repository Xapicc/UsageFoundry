/**
 * The three things an operator running a fleet can do to it at once.
 *
 * Every stop in this app was per run or per workflow instance, and at
 * twenty-five unattended runs across many repositories that is twenty-five HTTP
 * requests through twenty-five pages — so the only install-wide control was
 * stopping the container, which discards every in-flight cycle's accounting.
 * This module adds the three missing ones and *composes* them out of the
 * transitions that already exist rather than inventing a fourth way for a run to
 * end:
 *
 *   - `stopFleet` walks workflow instances through the one door they already
 *     have (`stopInstance`) and the runs outside them through `stopRun` and
 *     `blockWaitingRun`, choosing between the two with the very same
 *     `haltSteps` a workflow halt uses. There is no new status, no new signal
 *     path and no second answer to "which rows does this take down".
 *   - The hold on new work is `settings.newWorkPaused`, read by the four places
 *     that start work and by nothing else. It is documented beside the flag.
 *   - `reopenFleet` is `reopenRun` in a loop over an explicit list of ids, with
 *     one budget laid over each run's own rather than in place of it.
 *
 * This module sits *above* both `orchestrator.ts` and `workflows.ts` and nothing
 * in either imports it, which is what keeps the graph acyclic. The flag itself
 * lives in `settings.ts` precisely because it has to be readable from below.

 * left `thinking` while this walk ran could emit into a fleet that is being
 * taken down, every one of those runs arriving behind the walk. `stopInstance`
 * already closes that door before it signals anything, and reusing it is also
 * what keeps `workflow_instance_blocks`, the queued merges and the instance's
 * own recorded cause in step with the members.
 *
 * **Then waiting rows, before any live run is signalled**, which is `walkMembers`'
 * ordering for `walkMembers`' reason: stopping a run releases its dependents,
 * and a dependent released a moment before this reached it would be admitted,
 * promoted and spawned — a run starting *because* the fleet was stopped. The
 * whole walk is synchronous from the first instance to the last run, so nothing
 * can interleave with it.
 *
 * The one exposure this shares with a workflow halt is a queued run promoted by
 * an earlier stop inside the same turn: `promoteQueued` claims the row
 * synchronously, so the pass below sees it as `running` and `stopRun` reaches
 * it, and `startRun`'s pre-spawn checkpoint sees the interrupt before any child
 * exists. It costs a transcript scan, not a billed cycle.
 *
 * It does **not** set the hold on new work. That is a separate control and a
 * separate decision: an operator stopping a fleet to re-point it wants the
 * queue to carry on afterwards, and one that wants both presses both. The route
 * offers them together; this function does one thing.

 * on `created_at`, although a dependency is always created first: the stamp is a
 * millisecond and a workflow creates a chain inside one, so a tie would leave
 * the order to `id`, which is random. `created_at` is the tie-break instead —
 * `restartClosedRuns`' order, and the one the queue promotes in, since each pick
 * up promotes before the next is decided. Only edges inside the list matter: a
 * run that is not being picked up does not change while this loop runs, except

/**
 * Pick up several finished runs at once, under one budget.
 *
 * The list is the ids **the page displayed**, which is `POST /api/chat/[id]/approve`'s
 * rule and the same reasoning: a run that reached a terminal state between the
 * render and the click must not be swept into a reopen nobody saw. So there is
 * no "reopen everything failed" selector on the wire — the caller says which,
 * and `reopenRun` still refuses each one on its own terms and by name.
 *
 * The ids the page displayed are still only the page's answer, though, and one
 * of them may be a run the operator has since held back: `set_aside_at` is
 * checked here, against the row, at the moment of the write. Same rule the
 * server lock follows — a list is a reading, and a reading is stale.
 *
 * One budget for all of them, because the usual reason a fleet needs picking up
 * is one thing that ended all of it — a restart, a wall, a spending limit set too
 * low — and re-entering the same numbers twenty-five times is what makes the
 * existing route unusable at this scale rather than merely tedious. The per-run
 * refusals are unchanged: a run that has already used the cycles this budget
 * allows is still refused, and still says so.
 *
 * That one budget is **merged over each run's own stored blob rather than
 * substituted for it**, and the difference is the whole of this function's
 * correctness. `reopenRun` writes `budget=?` from the policy it is handed, so
 * handing it the sheet's two fields would rewrite every run's limits to the
 * two the sheet happens to expose and silently drop the rest — a time limit, a
 * token limit, an enforcement mode the operator chose per run, gone on a press
 * aimed at the cycle cap. Spreading the wire over the stored blob keeps an
 * explicit answer explicit (a blank cycle cap arrives as `null` and means "no
 * cycle limit" here exactly as it does anywhere else) while a field the sheet
 * never asked about keeps the value that run was started with. `permissionMode`
 * is untouched by this: it rides on the stored blob, `normalizePolicy` drops it,
 * and `reopenRun` reads it back off the row — reopening is not a second route
 * to `--permission-mode` and merging must not make it one.
 *
 * Sequential and synchronous, `approveProposal`'s rule: `createRun`'s folder
 * claim and `reopenRun`'s checkout check are only atomic inside one event-loop
 * turn, and two runs reopened into one checkout is exactly what that check
 * exists to stop. And in dependency order rather than the order the page sent,
 * for the reason `dependenciesFirst` gives.
