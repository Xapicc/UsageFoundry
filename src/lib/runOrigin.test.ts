/**
 * Which gate created each run, driven through the gates rather than asserted
 * about them.
 *
 * The point of the column is that it is *recorded* rather than deduced, so the
 * only test that says anything is one that goes through the real creation
 * paths: a `createRun({origin: "chat"})` written here would pin this file's own
 * argument and nothing about `approveProposal`. Every one of the five is
 * silent when it is wrong — the run starts, works and lands exactly as before,
 * and the only symptom is a row that says a person filled in a form when a
 * model decided it, months later, when somebody is trying to scope what a
 * stolen token did.
 *
 * Three of the five start an agent with nobody at the keyboard, which is the
 * whole reason the distinction is worth a column: `workflow` and `schedule` are
 * the same graph and the same `startWorkflow`, differing only in whether a
 * person pressed anything, and `orchestrator-block` is the one origin no person
 * chose run by run.
 *
 * Its own file with `DATA_DIR` named before the first import, for
 * `bootBlocks.test.ts`'s reason: `config.ts` is read at module load, so a file
 * that imported `orchestrator.ts` at the top would already be bound to the
 * repository's own `.data` — which on a developer's machine is the real one.
