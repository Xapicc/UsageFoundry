/**
 * Covers the parsing and the budgeting, and only those.
 *
 * Every one of them fails silently and expensively. A mis-parsed record shifts
 * every following file by one, so a rename in the middle of a change renames
 * the file list from there on — and a reviewer then writes a confident report
 * about work that happened somewhere else. The budget is the no-silent-caps
 * rule made executable: a diff that quietly shows twelve of forty files reads
 * as a run that touched twelve.
