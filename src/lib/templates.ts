/**
 * Named run templates: a saved task prompt and the guards it should run under.
 *
 * A template is **form input, not a run**. It holds no folder claim, consumes
 * no concurrency slot, and nothing derived from `activeRuns()` can see it — the
 * only thing it ever does is pre-fill `POST /api/runs`, which stays the sole
 * authority on every value it carries. That is the whole reason a template can
 * be this cheap: it never has to be reconciled on boot, and deleting one can
 * never orphan work.
 *
 * `permissionMode` is why the narrowing below is duplicated rather than
 * deferred. It reaches `--permission-mode` on a process that edits files, and a
 * template is a *second* route to that flag — the first being the run form, and
 * `reopenRun` refuses to become a third on exactly these grounds. So it is
 * narrowed on save (here), narrowed again on read (a row outlives the build
 * that wrote it), and narrowed a third time by `POST /api/runs`. Only the last
 * is load-bearing for safety. The first is what puts the mistake where it was
 * made instead of at the first attempt to use the template; the second is what
 * stops a value this build does not recognise from ever *widening* what a saved
 * template permits.
 *
 * **The model is here, and it used to be refused.** This paragraph replaces that
 * refusal rather than deleting it, because the reasoning is what a future reader
 * needs and the premise is what changed. The refusal said `settings.defaultModel`
 * already set the model globally and the run form did not offer one at all — so
 * a saved model would be a second place to set one thing, and the second place
 * is the one nobody remembers to check. The form offers one now, which turns
 * that argument around: a template that cannot save a model silently drops half
 * of what the form was set to, and the drift the refusal was written against
 * arrives anyway, from the other direction. What makes the second place
 * tolerable is `agents.ts`'s own ground for `agents.model`: **a model moves cost
 * and never capability**. Every cost guard already covers whatever it selects,
 * because the run's spend lands on its own `result` event and in its telemetry
 * whatever model produced it, and the two routes to `--permission-mode` are
 * still exactly two — this field reaches `--model` and nothing else. Precedence
 * is stated once and applied once: the run's own model wins, then this, then
 * `settings.defaultModel` at `createRun`, and an agent's model still only fills
 * a gap where the run named none, because an explicit `--model` outranks it.
 *
 * What a template deliberately does **not** hold:
 *
 * - **A last-used timestamp.** Ordering is by name, so the picker reads the way
 *   a person scans it. Most-recently-used would need a write on every
 *   instantiation and a `templateId` on the run wire that exists for nothing
 *   else — a lot of machinery to reorder a list of five.
 * - **Placeholders in the prompt.** The text lands in an editable textarea, so
 *   substituting a branch or a ticket number is already free.

   * An id rather than a copy, unlike `runs.agent` — see the column note in
   * `db.ts`. It carries no capability with it: an agent holds no tool list and
   * no permission mode, so this is not a fourth route to `--permission-mode`.
   *
   * What it reaches is the **new-run form**, as a seed for the picker there, the
   * same treatment `mountId`/`folder` get and not the treatment the prompt and
   * the guards get. The two server-side readers of a template deliberately do
   * not inherit it: `planProposal` takes the agent off the proposal and
   * `planNode` takes it off the node, each for its own stated reason, so a chat
   * proposal made under this template gets its prompt, its guards and its model
   * from here and its agent from itself. Saying "it carries onto the run like
   * the guards do" would be true of the form and false of both of those.
   *
   * `model` beside it is the deliberate asymmetry rather than an oversight, and
   * it survives a proposal having gained one of its own. A proposal and a node
   * each name their own agent, so inheriting one here would override an answer
   * those surfaces already gave. A node still names no model, so this is the
   * only answer it has; a chat proposal may name one, and *that* one wins —
   * which is inheritance working rather than an exception to it, since null on
   * the proposal is what falls through to here.

   * does not apply here**: that one exists because a permission mode reaches a
   * flag deciding what a spawned process may *do*, so a value this build does
   * not recognise must never widen it — this one reaches `--model`, which
   * decides what a run costs and nothing else.
   *
   * Unlike `agentId`, this **is** inherited by the two server-side readers of a
   * template: `planProposal` and `planNode` take it with the prompt and the
   * guards. See the note on `agentId` above for the asymmetry and why it is one.
