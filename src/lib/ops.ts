 * counter that survived a restart would answer that question about a process
 * that is gone. Anything that has to outlive the process is a row in SQLite
 * instead (see `ops_events` in `db.ts`).

 * `next dev`, and a sweeper-age reading that resets to "never" each time it is
 * read is worse than no reading. Its own key rather than a field added to
 * `__ufTimers` because `??=` only initialises when the key is *absent* — a
 * hot reload would keep the pre-upgrade object and every new field would read
 * `undefined` for the life of the dev server.
