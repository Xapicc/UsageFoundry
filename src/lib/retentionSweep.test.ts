/**
 * Covers what the retention sweep deletes from the database, and what it must
 * leave exactly as it found it.
 *
 * `run_events` grew monotonically — every assistant block, every tool call with
 * its whole input, every stderr chunk, ~13 MB per thousand tool events — into a
 * named volume with no size limit, and there was not one `DELETE` for growth
 * anywhere in the codebase. When such a volume fills, every SQLite write fails
 * at once: no run is admitted, no status is written, and `promoteQueued`
 * swallows the rejection, so runs simply stop starting with nothing on any page
 * saying why.
 *
 * It earns a test on the same grounds `mergeQueueOrder.test.ts` does: the
 * decision *is* the SQL. A predicate written beside the query would be a second
 * copy of the rule, and the copy is the one that would stay right — while both
 * ways of getting the real one wrong are silent and expensive in opposite
 * directions. Delete too little and the store is still unbounded; delete too
 * much and a run's own spend record, or the log of a run whose page somebody is
 * reading right now, goes with it.
 *
 * Its own file for that file's reason: `config.ts` reads `DATA_DIR` at module
 * load, so the throwaway directory has to be named before anything that reaches
 * the database is imported — otherwise the path is bound to the repository's
 * own `.data`, which on a developer's machine is the real one.
