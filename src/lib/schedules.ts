/**
 * When a saved workflow starts itself.
 *
 * **This is the first thing in this app that starts an agent with no person
 * present at all.** The run form, the chat's approval route and a workflow's Run
 * button all have somebody pressing something at the moment the spend begins;
 * a schedule moves that moment to whenever the operator happens not to be
 * looking. Everything below is shaped by that one fact, and the invariant in
 * CLAUDE.md says which properties are load-bearing. In short:
 *
 *   - **Guards still come from what a person wrote.** Nothing here reaches
 *     `--permission-mode`, a budget or an isolation choice. A schedule presses
 *     Run; `startWorkflow` does the rest exactly as it does for a click, so each
 *     block's guards come from its template or from `settings.chatDefaultGuards`
 *     and the instance guard and the instance stop cover a scheduled instance
 *     unchanged.
 *   - **A workflow with no instance budget cannot be scheduled at all.** See
 *     `scheduleRefusal`.
 *   - **A missed window is not made up.** See `decideSchedule` and
 *     `reconcileSchedulesOnBoot`.
 *   - **An overlap is skipped with a reason, and repeated skips are one
 *     state.** See `decideSchedule` and `recordOutcome`.
 *
 * The decision itself — fire, skip, missed, idle — is pure and unit-tested,
 * because both ways of getting it wrong are expensive and neither throws: a
 * schedule that fires twice bills twice, and one that never fires is
 * bit-for-bit what a working schedule looks like on a quiet day.

 * solve, though — it depends on where the nominal time sits in UTC relative to
 * the transition instant, so it goes forward in Berlin (whose clocks move at
 * 01:00Z, already behind a 02:30 nominal) and backward in a zone that moves them

 * was asked for and the first pass is still on it, which is the only case where

 * **A workflow whose instance budget sets nothing is refused**, and the choice

 *
 * The precedent is an orchestrator block's fan-out cap, which
 * `normalizeWorkflowInput` refuses to leave null for a reason stated in exactly
 * these terms: it is the one block whose runs start with nobody looking, so a
 * missing ceiling is an unbounded number of billed agents from one press of Run.
 * A schedule is that argument one level up. Every other press of Run is bounded
 * by a person being there to see what it cost and decide whether to press it
 * again; a schedule removes the person and keeps the press.
 *
 * Warning was the alternative and it fails on what it would be warning about: a
 * banner is read once, when the schedule is created, and the spend it is about
 * happens every hour for the next month. Allowing fails harder — the app's
 * standing rule is that a guard with nothing behind it is refused rather than
 * ignored, because silently passing leaves the operator believing a guard is
 * active.
 *
 * Any one of the three limits is enough. `maxInstanceCostUSD` bounds one press;
 * the two window fractions are the ones that bound *repetition*, since an
 * instance that would start into an already-spent window is refused at
 * `startWorkflow`'s door — which is why this asks `instanceBudgetIsOff` rather
 * than asking for a cost limit by name.
 *
 * Checked at creation, where there is an error channel and a person, and again
 * at every fire, because clearing the budget on the workflow afterwards is one
 * edit away and nothing about that edit knows a schedule exists.
