/**
 * Covers the two readings of an assist's output — the CLI's own result object
 * and the tool calls on the way to it — and `settleOnExit`, and only those.
 *
 * `parseReviewOutput`'s failure mode is the same one `spent_usd` guards against
 * elsewhere: a review that was billed and recorded at $0. Cost is read from
 * `total_cost_usd` — the CLI's own figure — and never re-derived from tokens,
 * so a shape this parser does not recognise is spend that silently vanishes.
 *
 * `settleOnExit` decides whether an assist ever ends, and it is the one thing
 * here that earns a *real* subprocess: the fault it guards against cannot be
 * reproduced without one, because pipes a grandchild holds open are the whole
 * mechanism. Wired to `close` alone — which is what this was — a review or a
 * conflict resolution whose answer is already sitting in the buffer never
 * lands: the row stays `running`, `assistRunning` refuses every further assist
 * for that run, and a resolution's throwaway checkout is left registered
 * mid-merge because `after` never runs.
