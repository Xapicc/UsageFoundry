 * The floor below which gzip is refused.

 * Two measurements, not a guess. Against the running container, the small

 * 586→336: below roughly 250 bytes the deflate header and the trailer cost
 * more than the redundancy they buy, and the answer comes back *larger*. That
 * puts the break-even near 250, which would be the floor if bytes were the
 * only thing being spent.
 *
 * They are not, and the second measurement is the one that sets the number. A
 * body under one TCP segment — an Ethernet MSS is about 1460 bytes — already
 * crosses the wire in a single packet, so compressing it saves no round trip
 * at all; what it costs is a threadpool hop, a second allocation of the whole
 * body, and a `Vary` that splits any cache entry in front of the app in two.
 * 1400 is one segment with room for the headers, and every route this is
 * wired into answers either far below it (`/api/knowledge/note` on a missing
 * path, 59 bytes) or far above it (`/api/runs`, 175 KB after the list trim, and
 * `/api/usage`, measured at 54,512 bytes against a live build). Nothing here

/**
 * A JSON response, gzipped when the client accepts it and the body is worth
 * the pass. Otherwise byte-identical to what `NextResponse.json` would have
 * sent, minus the encoding headers.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Next installs its `compression` hook on **every** request — `router-server.js`
 * calls it unconditionally unless `config.compress === false`, which this app
 * does not set — and HTML from this same server does come back gzipped. No
 * `/api` response ever did, and the tell was the absent `Vary: Accept-Encoding`
 * rather than the absent `Content-Encoding`: the hook sets `Vary` *before* it
 * checks the size threshold, so a response missing `Vary` never reached the
 * threshold check.
 *
 * The reason is not that route handlers flush their own headers — they do, in
 * `pipe-readable.js`, but that happens through the patched `writeHead` and the
 * hook fires normally. It is that `sendResponse` copies a route handler's
 * headers across with `NodeNextResponse.appendHeader`, which stores **every**
 * value as an array (`base-http/node.js`): the raw response then holds
 * `content-type: ['application/json']`, `compression`'s default filter asks
 * `compressible()` about it, and `compressible()` returns false for anything
 * that is not a string. Every app-router route handler in this version is
 * filtered out of compression by a one-element array. Reproduced against
 * Next 15.5.23's own `sendResponse` and its own bundled `compression`, with
 * `DEBUG=compression` printing `not compressible` then `no compression:
 * filtered` for the handler path and `gzip compression` for a plain
 * `res.end()` on the same server.
 *
 * That also means this helper cannot be double-compressed: the hook bails on
 * the array before it looks at anything else, and were a future Next to fix
 * `appendHeader`, the next thing it checks is `Content-Encoding !== identity`,
 * which this sets. Both roads end in `nocompress`.
 *
 * ## Why the async zlib
 *
 * `gzipSync` would be one line shorter and is refused. This process runs the
 * fleet: twenty-five agents' worth of guards, the SSE bus, and the run loop's
 * own budget checks all live on this event loop, and a guard that evaluates
 * late is a run that spends past its ceiling. Measured here, `gzipSync` on an
 * 8.8 MB body blocks for 30.6 ms and fires **zero** timer callbacks while it
 * does, against 43 in an idle 50 ms; a 698 KB body blocks for 10 ms. The
 * promisified form costs the same wall clock (28.7 ms and 10.3 ms) and spends it
 * on the libuv threadpool instead. Those two bodies were `/api/knowledge/graph`
 * and `/api/runs` as they stood before the payload trims landed in the same
 * pass; they are cited as sizes rather than as routes, because neither route
 * answers with that many bytes any more. Note
 * that the threadpool is four wide by default and shared with every `fs` call
 * this app makes, which is the reason for the size floor above as much as the
 * byte count is.
 *
 * ## Vary
 *
 * Set on the uncompressed branch too. Nothing caches in front of a stock
 * install — compose binds 127.0.0.1 and the browser is the only client — but
 * an operator terminating TLS in front of this app is exactly the deployment
 * `next.config.ts` already sends HSTS for, and a shared cache that stored one
 * client's gzipped `/api/runs` and served it to a client that did not ask for
 * gzip would hand over a body that client cannot read. Announcing it on one
 * branch only is the version of that bug that survives testing, because the
 * response you test with is the compressed one.
