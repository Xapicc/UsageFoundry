/**
 * The context occupancy series — every one of whose failures is a graph that
 * draws, looks plausible, and is wrong.
 *
 * The reading itself is `apiContextTokens`, which `contextPruning.test.ts`
 * already pins. What is pinned here is everything built on top of it, and each
 * of the four has the same shape: nothing throws, nothing fails to typecheck,
 * and the only symptom is a line on a chart nobody can check against anything.
 *
 *  - **A sample below the ceiling is recorded.** The reading was already being
 *    taken on every live-guard tick and thrown away by `tokens < CEILING`, which
 *    discards every value a graph is made of. A regression that put the store
 *    back after that comparison would record only runs that were already over
 *    the ceiling — a series that exists, is never empty, and describes the
 *    minority of runs nobody needs a meter for.
 *  - **An unchanged frame writes nothing.** The ticker is time-based and one
 *    tool call routinely outlasts several ticks, so a row per tick makes the
 *    series mostly flat duplicates. That does not read as a bug; it reads as a
 *    run whose context was not growing, which is the opposite of what a meter
 *    exists to show.
 *  - **A sub-agent's turns are not this conversation's turns.** The exclusions
 *    are the ceiling's own and were carried over deliberately; dropping either
 *    inflates the turn axis on exactly the tool-heavy runs whose growth rate
 *    somebody is trying to read.
 *  - **A tick that writes nothing still records that it looked.** This is the
 *    same fact as the one above, read from the other end, and getting it wrong
 *    is the failure an operator actually reported: a run inside one sub-agent
 *    wrote no row for 22 minutes — every frame in that stretch was `isSidechain`
 *    and this measure excludes them — and the panel, which had only the newest
 *    row's timestamp to go on, said "read 22m ago" over a figure that was
 *    current the whole time. A dead poll and a conversation that is waiting look
 *    identical from one timestamp and call for opposite responses.
 *  - **Pruning being off does not switch the series off.** This is the trap the
 *    change was written against: sampling inside a function that returns early
 *    on `pruningEnabled()` leaves the indicator permanently blank on every
 *    install that has the feature switched off, install-dependent and silent.
 *    `sampleContext` therefore carries no gate at all — the gate lives one level
 *    up, in the orchestrator, over the *acting* half — and this file is where
 *    that decision is pinned rather than left to a comment.
