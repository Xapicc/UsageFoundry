/**
 * Covers the lock's decision, and only that.
 *
 * It earns a test on the same grounds `planItem` and `landRefusal` do: it is
 * pure, and both ways of getting it wrong are silent and expensive in opposite
 * directions. Claim while another server is alive and the four boot reconcilers
 * mark every in-flight run failed while its agent keeps working and keeps
 * billing — which is the incident this exists to prevent, and which typechecks,
 * throws nothing, and reads afterwards exactly like a server that restarted.
 * Refuse while nobody is there and the reconcilers never run at all, so a run
 * killed by a crash holds its folder for ever and every later run queues behind
 * an empty directory.
