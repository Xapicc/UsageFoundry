/**
 * The four pure functions Dreaming's behaviour is decided by, and every one of
 * them fails silently.
 *
 * `signatureOf` deciding two failures are different writes a second note beside
 * a note that is already there, which the destination vault's own conventions
 * name as the failure mode they exist to prevent — and nothing throws.
 * `selectWritable` off by one writes 1,177 notes into a 1,224-note vault
 * instead of 77, and the symptom is a vault, not an error. `dayKey` on the
 * wrong zone moves every day boundary the feature is denominated in, so a
 * failure seen twice in one local evening reads as a recurrence and qualifies
 * for a note. `parseNoteLines` mis-parsing leaves a ledger row pointing at
 * nothing, which is the one column that makes a wrong note retractable.
 *
 * The numbers asserted below are the ones in the Dreaming proposal
 * (`git show a74a1bb:"proposals/implemented - Dreaming/"`) and they were
 * measured by `scripts/ledger.mjs` over the same corpus. A change here that
 * moves them is a change to what the proposal claims.
