/**
 * What a process that does not own the data directory may do.
 *
 * The lock's *decision* is pure and covered next door in `serverLock.test.ts`.
 * What is covered here is the thing that decision was never wired to: with the
 * directory correctly reported as somebody else's, `createRun` went on
 * resolving a folder, inserting a row and spawning a billed agent. The claim
 * that keeps two agents out of one directory is a synchronous check-then-insert
 * and it is atomic because *one* event loop runs it, so a second process
 * admitting runs against this database is exactly the collision `db.ts` opens
 * by naming the single process as what prevents it — and it is silent: two
 * plausible rows, two agents, one checkout.
 *
 * Its own file, and the environment is set before anything is required, for the
 * reason every database-backed test here needs: `config.ts` fixes `DATA_DIR`
 * and `CLAUDE_HOME` at module load, and a static import would be hoisted above
 * it and run against the operator's own database.
 *
 * The control is half of it. A refusal that fired for every caller would pass
 * this test and break the app, so the same call is made again with the
 * directory owned and has to come back with a row.
