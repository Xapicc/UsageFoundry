/**
 * Covers one thing: a bookkeeping write or read that fails says so.
 *
 * `fork_attempts` shipped without the `suffix_bytes` column its own INSERT
 * names. The write threw at every fork, `recordForkAttempt` caught it and
 * returned null, and the table stayed empty — which is exactly what a fork
 * engine that had never run would also look like. A day of runs produced no
 * evidence about the thing being tested and nothing anywhere said why.
 *
 * The catch is still right: a receipt must not fail the run it describes. What
 * is under test here is that the failure now reaches `ops_events`, where an
 * operator reading the empty table can find it.
 *
 * It earns its own file for `schemaMigration.test.ts`'s first reason: `DATA_DIR`
 * has to be set before `config.ts` is imported, and a file that imported it at
 * the top would run against the repository's real database.
