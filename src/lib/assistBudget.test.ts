/**
 * Covers the process budget on every `claude` child that is not a work cycle.
 *
 * `maxConcurrentRuns` bounded one of the four kinds of child this app spawns.
 * The other three — a review, a merge-conflict resolution, an orchestrator chat
 * turn and a workflow block's deciding turn — consulted nothing, so a fleet
 * under a cap of 25 could carry an orchestrator turn per `thinking` block and a
 * turn per open chat on top of it, each a full Node process. Nothing in the app
 * or in `docker-compose.yml` bounded that, and the failure is the host running
 * out of memory rather than anything this app reports.
 *
 * It earns a place in this suite on the same grounds as the rest of it: every
 * way of getting it wrong is silent. A count that misses a table restores the
 * unbounded fleet and nothing anywhere says so; a count that includes a **merge**
 * block — which takes the identical `thinking` status from the identical
 * `claimBlock` and spawns no child at all — refuses an operator's chat turn to
 * make room for a process that does not exist. Neither throws, neither shows up
 * in a type, and both look exactly like the app working.
 *
 * It opens a database rather than testing the rule alone because that is where
 * the defect was: `assistBudgetRefusal` is pure and could be got right over a
 * count that reads one table. So the rows are real, and the three that must be
 * counted are written into the three different tables that record them.
 *
 * Its own file, and `DATA_DIR`/`CLAUDE_HOME` named before the first import, for
 * `chatTurn.test.ts`'s reason — `config.ts` fixes both at module load, and the
 * assertion in `before` is what keeps a change to that from running against the
 * operator's own database.
