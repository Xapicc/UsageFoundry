/**
 * What this app throws away, and what it promises to keep.
 *
 * Three stores grow with the work rather than with the configuration —
 * `run_events` in the named volume, `.uf-worktrees` on the workspace bind
 * mount, `~/.claude/projects` in the operator's own home — on three different
 * media, at three different rates. They are one module rather than three caps
 * because they share one question: what is safe to discard, and what does this
 * app promise about history it has already shown somebody.
 *
 * The answer is one sentence. **A run's row is permanent; everything behind it
 * is evidence, and evidence has a horizon.** Nothing here deletes a `runs` row,
 * a review, a workflow record or a setting, so every figure this app has put on
 * the dashboard, the runs list or a run's own state card keeps reading true —
 * the spend, the cycle count, the stop reason, the branch, the landing record.
 * What goes is the working material those figures were derived from: the event
 * log's payloads, the checkout on disk, the session transcript.
 *
 * Four properties are shared by every sweep here and none is optional.
 *
 *  - **Nothing in flight is touched.** A run that has not settled keeps its
 *    whole log; a checkout an active run holds is skipped by name; a transcript
 *    whose session belongs to a live run is not a candidate. Each sweep asks the
 *    *database* what is live rather than inferring it from a file's age.
 *  - **The decision is pure, the syscall is not.** What goes is decided by
 *    functions that are unit-tested against fixtures, for `releasableRuns`'
 *    reason: every way of being wrong here is silent, lands on somebody's disk,
 *    and throws nothing.
 *  - **A removal is recorded where the operator would look for it** — in the
 *    run's own log where there is a run, and in `retention.lastSweep`, which the
 *    Settings page shows beside the sizes.
 *  - **No sweep destroys the only copy of anything.** It removes no branch and
 *    no commit, it never touches the operator's own checkout, and what it does
 *    remove is evidence for a figure that is already recorded elsewhere.
 *
 * Every horizon is `null`-able and `null` means keep for ever, the reading
 * every switchable rule in this app takes.
