/**
 * Which process owns this data directory.
 *
 * `db.ts` opens with the reason this matters: the folder claim that keeps two
 * agents out of one directory is a synchronous check-then-insert, and it is
 * only atomic because one process runs it. Everything here exists because that
 * assumption turned out to be reachable from inside the product — an agent
 * working on UsageFoundry itself starts a dev server to check its work, and
 * `next dev` runs `instrumentation.ts`, which runs the four boot reconcilers.
 * Pointed at the live database by an inherited `DATA_DIR`, one of those closed
 * out three runs whose agents were mid-cycle and carried on working. The row
 * said the server had restarted; nothing had.
 *
 * `childEnv` withholding `DATA_DIR` is what stops that particular route, and
 * the uid split is what makes the withholding enforceable — a child cannot read
 * the variable out of `/proc/<server>/environ` any more, and cannot open the
 * directory even knowing the path, because it belongs to the server at 0700.
 * This is still the check that does not depend on either: whatever a second
 * process is and however it found the file, it does not get to close out rows
 * belonging to a server that is still running. It is also the one that survives
 * an unseparated install — `npm run dev` on a laptop, where the lock and the
 * variable are all there is.
 *
 * The lock is a file rather than a row because it has to answer a question
 * about the database from outside it, and because a heartbeat every second is
 * WAL churn nobody needs.

 * Silence after which the owner is presumed gone.
 *
 * Derived from the worst-case synchronous block rather than chosen against an
 * assumption, because the previous figure — 15 s — was **shorter than a single
 * git call**. `gitSync` is a `spawnSync` with `GIT_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS` on it, and
 * one `git status --porcelain` on a large checkout with `core.fsmonitor`
 * cleared can reach that ceiling, so one admission-path call was sufficient to
 * miss the window with no other load at all. One admission makes several of
 * them in one uninterrupted stretch — `probeIsolation`'s `rev-parse`s, then a
 * `status` per candidate checkout slot — which is why the window has to be a
 * multiple of git's own ceiling rather than a fraction of it.
 *
 * A longer window costs very little, and that is a fact about `lockVerdict`
 * rather than optimism. Staleness is the *second* question it asks — after only
 * "is there a lock at all", and before both pid comparisons — so it decides two
 * cases rather than one. The case the window is really about is "the lock's pid
 * is alive and has stopped beating", because a live pid that has stopped
 * beating is a *stalled owner*, which is precisely the one that must not be
 * claimed: taking it runs the six boot reconcilers over runs whose agents are
 * still working and still billing. A longer window only waits longer before
 * claiming that, which is the safe direction. The second case is a lock whose
 * beat is old and whose pid is *also* gone — what a server killed without
 * releasing leaves behind, so the one an operator actually meets. Asking
 * staleness first claims it outright instead of sending it to the four-second
 * observation, and that is a shortcut rather than a second answer: a dead pid
 * and a beat older than this window are two independent readings of the same
 * corpse, and the observation would end in `claim` as well unless a third
 * process wrote the file inside those four seconds — which `heartbeatVerdict`
 * settles within a beat either way. Lengthening the window makes that case four
 * seconds slower and never wrong, since past the window it is `observe` again
 * and still ends in a claim. A missing lock is claimed outright, and so is one
 * carrying our own pid — the container restart, where the server reliably lands
 * where its predecessor was. What the longer window does cost is an owner that
 * died and whose pid a live process has since taken, which then holds the
 * directory for up to this long. Bounded, rare, and the cheaper mistake.
 *
 * It is no longer the only defence either, which is the other half of why the
 * exact figure matters less than it did: `heartbeatVerdict` means an owner that
 * loses the directory anyway finds out within a beat and stands down, rather
 * than restamping the file over the new owner's and leaving two processes both
 * believing they hold it for ever.
