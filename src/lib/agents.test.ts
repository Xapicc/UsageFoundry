/**
 * Covers the three pure functions that stand between an operator's form and a
 * flag the CLI drops in silence.
 *
 * They clear the bar for the same reason `normalizeTemplateInput` does — pure,
 * and every failure mode is quiet and expensive — but the quietness here is
 * measured rather than argued. Every one of these was tried against the pinned
 * CLI (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.226`) and it said nothing at all: a member
 * without a description is dropped, a member without a prompt is dropped, a
 * member whose model is JSON `null` is dropped, and a `--agents` value that is
 * not JSON is ignored entirely. Exit 0 in every case, no warning on stderr.
 *
 * That silence was the whole argument for validating here, and the move from
 * `--agents` to `--agent` **keeps the refusals and changes what they buy**. The
 * drop above is a drop from the set `--agent` resolves against, so a member the
 * CLI will not register is no longer a run quietly missing its agent — it
 * is a run whose every work cycle exits non-zero at the spawn, before any
 * request is made:
 *
 *     $ claude --agents '{"uf-nodesc":{"prompt":"p"}}' --agent uf-nodesc -p hi
 *     --agent 'uf-nodesc' not found. Available agents: claude, Explore,
 *     general-purpose, Plan, statusline-setup, typescript   (exit 1)
 *
 * Louder, and still worth refusing in front of the person who can fix it rather
 * than in a stderr line on a run that has already been started.
