/**
 * Covers `jsonNoStore`, and the wiring of the one page that has nothing but a
 * poll to learn from.
 *
 * The chat page has no SSE stream to correct it, so a cached body is the last
 * thing it ever sees; the status it can freeze on is `thinking`, which
 * disables the composer. That failure is silent by construction — every layer
 * involved is behaving correctly, the response simply never said not to store
 * it — which is the bar the rest of this suite is reserved for.
 *
 * The wiring half reads source text, which no other test here does. The
 * handlers cannot be called from `node --test`: they import through the `@/`
 * alias, which plain CommonJS does not resolve, and reaching one would open
 * SQLite. A header on the wire has no pure function behind it to test, so the
 * choice is a text assertion or no regression test at all.
