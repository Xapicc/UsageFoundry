/**
 * The control group's reading of which turn a clean resume actually was.
 *
 * `resumeControl` used to answer each probe by walking every main-thread turn on
 * the machine and skipping the ones belonging to another session; it now groups
 * the turns by session once and reads one group per probe. That is meant to be
 * the same loop over the only entries that could ever have answered it, and the
 * failure mode of being wrong is the silent kind: `warmShare` feeds
 * `netReceipt`, so a control that quietly picked another session's turn would
 * move every priced receipt's netUSD — the figure that decides whether pruning
 * looks worth keeping — with nothing throwing and nothing failing to typecheck.
 *
 * Untested before the change, so these pin the behaviour rather than describing
 * it: each case is one thing the old whole-corpus walk did that the grouped read
 * has to keep doing.
