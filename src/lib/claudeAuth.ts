/**
 * The fifth kind of child process, and the only one that starts no agent.
 *
 * `docs/agent/architecture.md` names four — the work cycle, the reviewer, the
 * orchestrator chat and git — and says a fifth is a decision. This is that
 * decision, and what makes it one rather than a detail is that it is the first
 * child spawned for its *side effect on disk* instead of for its output: it
 * rewrites the credential every other child authenticates with. It costs
 * nothing, holds no context window, reads no repository and takes no prompt, so
 * `maxConcurrentAssists` does not bound it; what bounds it is that at most one
 * login may be pending per install, below.
 *
 * It exists because the alternative was a shell. Signing the container in meant
 * `docker compose exec -it usagefoundry claude` and `/login` — a terminal, on
 * the host, for the one step that has to happen before any run can work at all,
 * and no way back out again short of editing the mounted directory by hand.
 *
 * Three commands, all of which the pinned CLI already answers non-interactively
 * given pipes rather than a tty:
 *
 *   `claude auth status --json`  a single JSON object, exit 0 either way
 *   `claude auth login`          prints an authorize URL, then reads the code
 *                                the browser hands back from **stdin**
 *   `claude auth logout`         prints one line, exit 0
 *
 * The middle one is why this module holds state. The CLI keeps the PKCE
 * verifier for a login in the memory of the process that printed the URL, so
 * the URL and the code are halves of one live child — a second `claude auth
 * login` would print a second URL whose code the first process cannot redeem.
 * That is the bound: one pending login, and starting another cancels it.
