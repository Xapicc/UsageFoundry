/**
 * Covers the agreement between `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` about who
 * may write the data directory, and who may not — the first of the deployment
 * agreements pinned here, and the only one this comment is about. The backup
 * path, the healthcheck, the mounted workspace slots and the container's memory
 * ceiling against the server's own stated heap each carry their reasoning below.
 *
 * It is not a pure function, and it earns its place on the same grounds the
 * rest of this suite does — a failure that is silent, expensive, and invisible
 * to every other check here. `/data` is a *named volume*, so Docker copies the
 * ownership and mode of the image's directory onto the volume root when it
 * first creates it, and nothing afterwards revisits that decision.
 *
 * **This file used to assert the opposite of what it asserts now, and the
 * inversion is deliberate.** The old rule was that `/data` must be
 * world-writable, because compose ran the *whole* container — server and
 * agents alike — as `${UF_UID:-1000}`, and a fresh volume left at `chown
 * node:node` plus the default 0755 belonged to uid 1000 alone: the app could
 * not create its SQLite file under any other uid, and every data route failed
 * for an operator who had just followed the instruction meant to prevent
 * permission problems. That reasoning was sound and its conclusion is now
 * wrong, because the premise moved. The server runs as root and drops its
 * children to `UF_AGENT_UID`, so it needs no grant to create the database —
 * while a world-writable `/data` hands twenty-five unattended agents the
 * settings every guard reads, the budget and status on every run, and the lock
 * `serverLock.ts` uses to decide whether a second writer exists. An agent that
 * can write that file sets `chatDefaultGuards.permissionMode` to
 * `bypassPermissions` with no HTTP request and no token.
 *
 * Nothing else notices either way: it typechecks, it builds, and both
 * arrangements start a container. Docker is not available in the environment
 * this repo's tests run in, so this pins the two halves against each other
 * rather than the behaviour; `docs/verification.md`'s "Not yet verified by
 * hand" carries the commands that check the behaviour itself.

/**
 * The sandbox switch, pinned across the four files that have to agree for it to
 * mean anything — and, first, for it to stay *off*.
 *
 * Same grounds as the gh block above, one boundary over and with more at stake
 * in both directions. `UF_SANDBOX` is read by `docker-entrypoint.sh` and by
 * nothing in the app, so a variable an operator sets in `.env` reaches the
 * container only if compose forwards it: dropped, it is a security control
 * switched on in a file, never written, and never applied — the
 * `UF_WORKSPACE_5_NAME` silence wearing a policy. The path is the same shape of
 * agreement pointing the other way: `src/lib/sandbox.ts` reports what confines
 * this install by *reading that file*, so a path that moves in one of the two
 * makes an install with a live policy report that it has none, which is the one
 * thing that row exists to prevent.
 *
 * And the direction this run had to get right at all: the switch ships off, and
 * `security_opt` ships commented. An uncommented seccomp line would make every
 * stock `docker compose up` depend on a profile file the daemon may reject, for
 * a sandbox nobody asked for. That reading is now measured rather than argued:
 * with the profile applied `bwrap` starts and without it the same command fails
 * at both uids, so the line decides something on every install that has one.
 * An operator who wants it puts it in a `docker-compose.override.yml`, which is
 * why this assertion did not have to move to enable a sandbox here. Docker is
 * not available where these tests run, so this pins the files against each
 * other; `docs/verification.md` carries the commands that check the behaviour,
 * and two of them now have answers.
 *
 * The forwarding assertion below is no longer about `UF_SANDBOX` alone. It
 * covers every `UF_` name the entrypoint reads, because the one that went
 * missing was the one no prefix had been written for.

/**
 * The ceiling on the container's own log, and the operator-facing page that
 * states it — the one store this app grows and does not own.
 *
 * `run_events`, the checkouts and the transcripts each have a retention
 * horizon, a figure on `/api/status` and a suggested alert. Container stdout
 * has none of the three, and it is written by this app on purpose: ten
 * structured event kinds beside the `[usagefoundry]` prose. Docker's
 * `json-file` driver keeps every line for ever unless compose says otherwise,
 * so the absence of a `logging:` block is a store with no bound at all — on the
 * same disk as the three that are bounded, and the one that will still be
 * growing after they have stopped.
 *
 * Nothing else can notice it. The compose file parses, the container starts,
 * every page works, and the evidence arrives months later as a full disk on a
 * host whose Docker directory nobody was watching. That is the same shape as
 * the `memswap_limit` and `stop_grace_period` pairs above: a value that is
 * correct in every observable way and wrong only in what it permits.
 *
 * The floor is the *bad* case rather than the ordinary one, because that is
 * what sized the number. `run.sandbox_refusal` is on stdout precisely so a
 * policy refusing every tool call is visible without opening twenty-five run
 * pages, and a cap that such a storm empties inside a shift hides the thing it
 * was widened for. So the window has to outlast one unattended night.
