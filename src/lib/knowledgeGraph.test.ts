/**
 * Every decision here fails silently, which is why they are all in one file.
 *
 * **The query is answered per keystroke and there is nothing to check it
 * against.** A term that parsed wrongly hides notes, and a graph with fewer
 * nodes in it looks exactly like a graph with fewer notes in it. The same
 * parser decides which colour group claims a node, so the same bug also paints
 * the wrong things.
 *
 * **The filter order decides what an orphan is.** Hiding attachments turns a
 * note whose only link was an embedded image into a note joined to nothing, so
 * an orphan filter answered against the *unfiltered* graph leaves it standing
 * in a view that was asked to hide orphans. Nothing throws either way.
 *
 * **The local graph is a traversal a person cannot verify by eye.** Depth,
 * direction and the neighbour-links toggle each change what is drawn, and a
 * wrong one reads as a vault with different links in it.
 *
 * **Saved settings are a browser value that survives an upgrade.** They arrive
 * as `unknown`, from a store an operator can edit and a previous release wrote,
 * and one field falling to `undefined` is a slider whose position is `NaN`.
 *
 * **The wire's links are positions rather than ids**, and `expandGraph` is the
 * only thing that ever reads one. A position resolved against the wrong array,
 * or off by one, is not a missing line: it is a line between two notes that are
 * not linked, in a picture nobody can check against the vault.
