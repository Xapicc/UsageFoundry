/**
 * Covers the three things on the conflicts map that have a decidable answer.
 *
 * Every one of them fails silently and draws a plausible picture instead of
 * throwing. A path filed under the wrong parent puts a clash in a directory that
 * is not on fire. A clash count summed over files nobody opened states a total
 * the preview never had, and there is nothing on a canvas that would contradict
 * it — which is why `regionsRead: false` has to survive the reduction as `null`
 * and not as a zero. And the several ways of having no conflict all render as an
 * empty canvas, which reads as a merge that is safe to land: three of them are
 * states where it is not.
 *
 * `clashKindOf` is in here for a fourth reason and it is the narrowest of the
 * lot: git's `-z` type field says `contents` where its prose says `content`, so
 * a classifier written from the message would put every ordinary conflict in the
 * "some other kind" bucket, on a map where nothing would look broken.
 *
 * The drawing is deliberately not tested, for `touchedMap.test.ts`'s reason:
 * there is no DOM here and an assertion over a radius or a colour restates the
 * code rather than checking it.
