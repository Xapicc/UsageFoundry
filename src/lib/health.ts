/**
 * What `GET /api/health` answers with, and how it decides.
 *
 * The point of this file is that a health check which returns 200 because the
 * HTTP layer is up says nothing about a server that has stopped working. So
 * every field below is something that is *actually false* when this process
 * cannot do its job, and the route's status code is derived from them rather
 * than from having been reached.
 *
 * **What this detects.**
 *  - SQLite unopenable or unwritable — a real read and a real write lock, so a
 *    read-only data directory, a missing file and a corrupt handle all fail.
 *  - This process no longer owning `DATA_DIR` — its heartbeat stopped, so its
 *    reconcilers and sweepers are no longer entitled to act (`serverLock.ts`).
 *  - A sweeper that has stopped making progress while parked runs wait for it,
 *    and one whose every tick is throwing (`ops.ts`).
 *  - Event-loop *congestion*, as the delay a zero-delay timer actually takes.
 *
 * **What it cannot detect, and what covers it instead.**
 *  - A loop blocked outright. Nothing here runs, because the request is never
 *    handled — that case is the probe's own timeout, which is why the
 *    `HEALTHCHECK` in the Dockerfile sets one and why it is short relative to
 *    the interval. A field in this body could never report it.
 *  - Whether there is disk space to *commit* a write. The probe takes the write
 *    lock; it does not fill a page.
 *  - Whether any agent is making progress. That is `/api/status`, which answers
 *    "what is it doing" where this one answers "should Docker restart this".
 *
 * **What must never be added to the response**: run prompts, folder or mount
 * paths, settings values, tokens, model names, or anything read off a
 * transcript. The route is unauthenticated by design (see `middleware.ts`), and
 * it stays safe to leave open only for as long as it carries counts and nothing
 * else.
