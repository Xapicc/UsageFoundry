/**
 * Covers how many times one aggregation runs for N concurrent callers, and only
 * that.
 *
 * `scanUsage` coalesces the *file reads* and nothing coalesced what comes after
 * them, which is the expensive half on a large history: a filter and a full
 * allocation per caller, then `buildSessionBlocks` plus two more filters plus
 * three `groupBy` rollups over every entry the process has ever parsed. The
 * pre-cycle guard is the path every run takes, so N runs reaching a cycle
 * boundary together did N full-history aggregations back to back on the one
 * event loop — `liveGuardTick` states that exact property one function over and
 * works around it for its own callers.
 *
 * What is pinned is a *count*, deliberately, and never a wall clock: the whole
 * defect is invisible from any value the app produces — every one of those N
 * aggregations returns the same answer — so a timing assertion is the only other
 * way to see it and a timing assertion in CI is a flake.
 *
 * Its own file for one reason: the question is what a *cold* process does with
 * N simultaneous callers, and any other test in the same process that reached
 * `currentSnapshot()` first would have already answered it. It also replaces
 * `buildSnapshot` module-wide, which every other case beside it would then be
 * counted through.
