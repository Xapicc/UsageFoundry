/**
 * Covers the merge preview parser and the refusal decision, and only those.
 *
 * They are the two places where being wrong writes into a directory a person
 * owns. `parseMergeTree` reading a failure as "no conflicts" would offer a
 * merge that cannot work; `landRefusal` missing a branch would merge into a
 * dirty tree, or onto the wrong branch, and neither is something this app can
 * undo afterwards. `conflictRegions` earns its place for the reason
 * `hasConflictMarkers` does: it decides what counts as a conflict marker in
 * arbitrary file content, and a parser that fires on a markdown heading
 * underline renders half a document as a conflict.
 *
 * `commitRefusal` and `purgeRefusal` clear the same bar from the other end.
 * One decides whether to make a commit in a checkout — where the expensive
 * mistake is committing a slot's contents onto the branch of whichever run took
 * that slot over next — and the other decides whether to destroy a branch
 * nothing has landed, which is the only action here git cannot undo.
 * `parseStatusZ` is what both of them count, and it is a parser over arbitrary
 * filenames whose first character is significant.
 *
 * `gitFailureLine` and `trackedDirt` are the two readings that decide whether a
 * conflict resolution can start, and both fail silently by producing a
 * plausible answer. The first reported git's progress line to an operator as
 * the reason their resolution would not run; the second decides whether the
 * run's own slot may be merged in, where saying "dirty" about an untracked file
 * makes resolution permanently impossible and saying "clean" about a tracked
 * one folds the run's uncommitted work into the merge commit.
