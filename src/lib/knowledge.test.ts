/**
 * The vault parser, its resolver and its cache.
 *
 * Every failure mode here is silent, which is the bar `docs/agent/testing.md`
 * sets. A link form the scanner does not know is not an error: it is a note
 * that reads as having fewer connections than it has, on a page whose whole
 * purpose is to show connections. A resolution order that puts aliases before
 * filenames draws edges nobody wrote. And a cache that does not notice an
 * edited file shows yesterday's graph indefinitely, with a "last scan" beside
 * it saying the scan just happened.
 *
 * ## Why the fixture is a literal
 *
 * There is no fixture-directory convention in this repo — every test that needs
 * files builds them in `fs.mkdtempSync` and removes them in `after()`, which is
 * what this does. Declaring the vault as a `Record<path, contents>` keeps the
 * fixture in git where it can be read beside the assertions, and materialising
 * it on disk is what makes the last test in this file possible at all: cache
 * invalidation is a claim about `mtimeMs` and `size`, and nothing that is not a
 * real file has either.
