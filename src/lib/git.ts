 * a repository gets git to run a command of its choosing (`core.fsmonitor` and
 * hooks — `worktree add` fires `post-checkout`, `merge` fires
 * `pre-merge-commit`/`commit-msg`); and the environment is stripped of this
 * app's configuration anyway, because the drivers reached through
 * `.gitattributes` are repository-controlled too and `diff.ts` disables those
 * per call rather than here. Terminal prompting is disabled because these
 * children have no stdin; a credential prompt would otherwise hang until a

 * `serverLock.ts` names it as the variable withholding exists to protect, and
 * nothing git does needs to know where this app's database is.
 *
 * `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `HOME` still pass through, as they do for the agent —
 * git reads `HOME` for its own configuration, and an allowlist here would fail
 * in ways that are tedious to diagnose from inside a container.
 *
 * `NODE_OPTIONS` is on the list for the reason `childEnv` gives, and it is not
 * dead weight here even though git ignores it: the hooks, `textconv` drivers
 * and `core.fsmonitor` this child can be made to run are repository-controlled

/**
 * `core.fsmonitor` is a command git runs, so it is cleared on every call.
 *
 * `core.hooksPath` is cleared for exactly that reason and is the larger half of
 * it: a hook is a repository-controlled command that git runs, `worktree add`
 * and `checkout` fire `post-checkout`, and `merge`/`commit` fire four more —
 * inside the operator's own checkout, at a moment the operator triggered. An
 * agent can write `.git/hooks/post-checkout` in any repository it works in, and
 * a run started afterwards would execute it as this server's git child, outside
 * the CLI's permission model entirely. `/dev/null` is not a directory, so git
 * finds no hook there and carries on; verified against 2.39, including that it
 * outranks a `core.hooksPath` the repository sets in its own `.git/config`.
 *
 * This is the git *this app* runs, and nothing here reaches the agent's own:
 * `buildArgs` passes no config at all, so a repository's `pre-commit` still runs
 * for the run that was asked to commit. That is part of the work.
 *
 * `safe.directory` is waived for the same reason the image waives it: a
 * bind-mounted repository carries the host's uid, which need not be this
 * process's, and git's refusal is indistinguishable from "not a repository" by
 * the time `probeIsolation` sees it. The check it disables guards against
 * repositories reached by surprise on a shared host; every path that gets here
 * has already been proved to sit inside a configured mount by `resolveInMount`.

/**
 * Async twin of `gitSync`, for everything outside the admission decision.
 *
 * `worktree add` is a full checkout — minutes on a large repository — and the
 * synchronous form would hold the event loop for all of it, stalling every
 * other run's event stream and every poll in every open tab.
 *
 * `maxBytes` bounds stdout for the callers that read a diff: an unbounded read
 * of a generated-file change is a heap the server does not have. Hitting it
 * kills the child and reports `ok: false` rather than returning a patch that is
 * short by an unstated amount.
 *
 * `trim: false` is for the one output shape where leading whitespace carries
 * meaning: `git status --porcelain` writes an unstaged edit as `" M path"`, and
 * trimming the stream eats that first space — which shifts the whole record and
 * reads the status letters off the middle of a filename.
 *
 * `timeoutMs: 0` runs with **no clock at all**, and it exists for the landing
 * path. A timeout here is a `SIGKILL`, which arrives at the caller as
 * `ok: false` and is indistinguishable from git having refused — so a merge on
 * a large repository was rolled back and reported as "git refused the merge"
 * for the sole reason that it took longer than a number nobody measured. There
 * is no length of time after which merging somebody's work becomes the wrong
 * thing to do, so `land.ts` passes this on every call that decides or performs
 * one. Memory is still bounded by `maxBytes` where a caller reads a diff, and
 * an unbounded call is still killed when the process ends.
 *
 * **It never rejects, and that is a contract the whole app was already reading
 * it as having.** Not every failure to start a child reaches the `error` event:
 * `spawn` demotes exactly `EACCES`/`EAGAIN`/`EMFILE`/`ENFILE`/`ENOENT` to one,
 * and throws every other errno synchronously — `ENOTDIR` from a `cwd` that has
 * become a file, `EPERM` from `childCredentials()`. `EMFILE` and `ENFILE` are
 * worse than a throw from `spawn`: they *return*, having deliberately skipped
 * the stdio wiring, so `child.stdout` is `undefined` and the `setEncoding`
 * below is what throws — and file descriptors are the resource this app is
 * closest to spending, at four merge workers each running a dozen git children
 * beside a fleet of agents. Every caller in `land.ts` reads a `GitResult` and
 * none of them has a `catch`, so a rejection propagated out of the merge
 * worker's loop and left the row it was landing stuck on `landing` for ever.
 * A child that could not be started is reported as the failed call it is.
