/**
 * What every `<canvas>` in this app needs and none of them should own.
 *
 * `KnowledgeGraphCanvas` was the first canvas here, so it answered the
 * questions a canvas asks — how a world coordinate becomes a screen one, how a
 * click finds what is under it, how a backing store is sized on a retina
 * display, what a wheel notch is worth — and it answered them privately. A
 * second canvas could only copy those answers, and a copy is where two surfaces
 * start disagreeing about what a drag does. They live here instead.
 *
 * ## What belongs here, and what does not
 *
 * The line is **what a pixel is**, not **what is drawn on it**. This module may
 * know that a view has a pan and a scale, that a hit is the nearest circle
 * within reach, and that a `deltaMode` of 1 means lines. It may not know what a
 * node is, what it should be coloured, what its radius means or where its data
 * came from — that is the consumer's, and a consumer that finds itself passing
 * domain knowledge in as an argument (`reachOf`, `marginPx`, the token list)
 * has the split right. Nothing here imports React or reaches for a ref: the
 * pure arithmetic is testable without a DOM, and the three functions that do
 * touch the DOM take their elements as arguments and return their own teardown.
 *
 * ## Why the transform is functions over a value, not a class
 *
 * A `View` is three numbers and every gesture is a total function from one to
 * the next. Written that way the whole transform is unit-testable — that a zoom
 * leaves the point under the cursor fixed is an assertion, not something a
 * person checks by eye — and the caller keeps its own storage, which in the
 * knowledge graph is a ref that a frame reads without re-rendering.
 *
 * ## Colour cannot be read from a variable
 *
 * Every token in `globals.css` is a `light-dark()` or a `color-mix()` and no
 * `@property` registers any of them, so `getPropertyValue("--fg")` returns the
 * literal source text — which is not a value `ctx.fillStyle` accepts. The only
 * thing that resolves one is an element. `probeTokens` is that element, and
 * `observeTheme` is the pair of boundaries across which its answer changes
 * without the component rendering.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and client-safe: no `node:` import, nothing that
 * opens SQLite. `src/lib` is also what `tsconfig.test.json` compiles, which is
 * why the arithmetic lives here rather than beside a component — a transform
 * that is wrong draws a plausible picture, and the only way to catch that is an
 * assertion.
