/**
 * The record behind an issued `uf_session` cookie.
 *
 * `sessionToken.ts` says what the cookie *is*; this says what the server knows
 * about the ones it handed out. The two are separate files because they live in
 * different runtimes: the cookie has to be checkable by the edge middleware,
 * and this touches SQLite, which that runtime cannot reach.
 *
 * What it buys is the thing the old cookie had none of. When the cookie was
 * `UF_AUTH_TOKEN` there was no session — no count, no issue time, no way to end
 * one, and the only remedy for a leaked copy was editing `.env` and restarting
 * the container, which kills every run in flight. A row per sign-in makes
 * "revoke this one" and "how many are outstanding" ordinary questions.
