/**
 * What a boot makes of the configuration it was handed.
 *
 * `config.ts` made no filesystem call at all and treated an explicitly blank
 * variable as identical to an unset one, so every way of pointing this app at
 * the wrong place presented the same way: a container that starts, answers
 * `/login`, and shows an empty dashboard — which is also what a quiet week
 * looks like. The expensive one is `DATA_DIR=`, which reads as a request for
 * the default, puts the SQLite file inside the image's writable layer, and
 * loses every run, setting and workflow on the next `docker compose up --build`.
 *
 * **Which check refuses and which warns is the decision this module makes, and
 * it is not one rule applied evenly.**
 *
 * `DATA_DIR` **refuses**: it is the one value that decides where this app's
 * only copy of anything lives. A boot that carries on writing to a directory
 * the operator did not name is a boot that is manufacturing the data loss, and
 * every minute it serves adds rows to the wrong file. Refusing costs a restart;
 * continuing costs the history. It is also the check that can be made without
 * ambiguity — a directory this process cannot create a file in is not a matter
 * of degree.
 *
 * A **mount** and `CLAUDE_HOME` only **warn**, and the asymmetry is deliberate.
 * A workspace is optional by design: compose mounts four slots unconditionally
 * and three of them usually point at the same host directory, a bind source can
 * be temporarily unavailable (an unmounted disk, a network share still coming
 * up), and `CLAUDE_HOME/projects` legitimately does not exist until the machine
 * has run Claude Code once. Refusing there would take the dashboard, the run
 * history, the merge queue and every other page away from an operator whose
 * install is *degraded* rather than broken — and it would do it for a folder
 * picker that would merely have been empty. So they are reported: loudly on
 * stdout at boot, and on the dashboard, which is where somebody is actually
 * looking. An explicitly blank variable other than `DATA_DIR` warns for the
 * same reason: it is almost always a mistake, and it is never the mistake that
 * destroys anything.
