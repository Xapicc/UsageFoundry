/**
 * Covers what the install-wide ceiling is *measured from*, which the pure
 * verdict beside it cannot.
 *
 * `evaluateInstallBudget` answers correctly about any pair of figures it is
 * handed. What is easy to get wrong — and silent, because the result is a
 * plausible dollar amount either way — is the reading: a SUM across three
 * tables, each bounded on a different column, with a fourth contribution
 * arriving through `telemetrySpendSince` for cycles that have reported nothing.
 * A window bound applied to the wrong column, or a table left out, produces a
 * ceiling that is quietly larger than the one the operator typed.
 *
 * Its own file, and `DATA_DIR`/`CLAUDE_HOME` set before the first import, for
 * `haltedMembers.test.ts`' reason: `config.ts` reads both at module load. It is
 * separate from `instanceBudget.test.ts` for a further reason of its own — this
 * reading covers *every* run row in the database, so that file's fixtures would
 * be inside its window and it would be inside theirs.
