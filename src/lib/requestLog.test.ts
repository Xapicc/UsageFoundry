/**
 * What a mutating request leaves behind, and — the half that matters more —
 * what it does not.
 *
 * The audit line is the only record that a request happened at all, so it is
 * the one place in this app where *adding* a field is the dangerous direction.
 * Every mutating request goes through this wrapper: `POST /api/runs` carries
 * the prompt of every run, `POST /api/login` carries the master token in its
 * body, and a query string is where a credential ends up when somebody puts one
 * there by mistake. A body-logging line here would write the credential this
 * app exists to protect into a table and onto stdout, and nothing would fail —
 * it would typecheck, pass every other test, and be discovered by whoever reads
 * the logs.
 *
 * So this drives the wrapper against handlers that are handed exactly those
 * things and asserts the row is method, path, status, subject, actor class,
 * address and duration, with the secret nowhere in it.
 *
 * Its own file with `DATA_DIR` set before the first import, for
 * `runOrigin.test.ts`'s reason.
