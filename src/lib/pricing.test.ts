 * The cache read rate, which stopped being a constant when the 5.1 pair
 * shipped at 0.025× against everything else's 0.10×.
 *
 * Every failure below is silent in the way this suite exists for: the model
 * resolves, the price resolves, the two visible columns — $10 input, $50 output
 * — are identical between Claude Fable 5 and Claude Fable 5.1, and the only
 * symptom of getting it wrong is a dollar figure that is 4× too large on the
 * one line item a Claude Code workload is almost entirely made of. Nothing
 * throws, nothing fails to typecheck, and a budget guard refuses a run against
 * a ceiling it never reached.
 *
 * Rates are `docs/verification.md`'s, read from the published pricing table
 * rather than derived: Fable 5.1 and Mythos 5.1 charge $0.25/MTok for a cache
 * hit, every other model 0.10× its own input.
