/**
 * Landing several branches, one after another.
 *
 * This reverses a decision the rest of the codebase states outright — "several
 * branches is several merges, and each one changes the base for the next, so it
 * is one button per run" — and it only gets to do that by keeping what that
 * decision protected:
 *
 *   - **Exactly one merge is in flight per repository.** Not a batch, a queue.
 *     A worker is a single sequential loop and there is one of them per
 *     repository — never two, which is the invariant the whole module rests on
 *     and the one thing a reader of `startWorker` has to keep true.
 *   - **Every item is re-previewed against git immediately before its own
 *     merge.** Each landing changes the base for the next, so an answer worked
 *     out when the queue was made is worthless by the second item. Nothing here
 *     trusts what the page showed; `landRun` re-derives the whole `LandState`
 *     and refuses on its own reading. That sentence is true of two branches in
 *     one repository and false of two branches in different ones, which is why
 *     the repository is the unit of serialisation rather than the process:
 *     draining every repository through one loop meant a twelve-minute conflict
 *     resolution in one of them held every clean branch in all the others.
 *   - **A conflict still costs the operator's checkout nothing.** It is resolved
 *     on the run's branch in an isolated checkout, exactly as the single-run
 *     path does it, and a failed merge is aborted and rolled back before the
 *     queue moves on.
 *   - **A problem with the checkout itself stops that repository.** A dirty tree
 *     or a HEAD on the wrong branch will refuse every remaining branch in the
 *     same repository for the same reason, and reporting that ten times is
 *     noise. The rest are marked skipped, once, with the reason.
 *
 * **It spends money, and that is the whole reason `auto_resolve` is a per-batch
 * flag on every row rather than a setting.** `review.ts` says nothing automatic
 * may reach it, because spend nobody asked for is spend nobody authorised —
 * queueing with the box ticked *is* that authorisation, and it is recorded next
 * to the work it authorised rather than read from configuration that could have
 * changed since.

 * Work one repository's queue until it is empty, one branch at a time.

 * because a worker now covers exactly one repository — the same decision, with
 * the key moved into the loop's identity. A dirty checkout or a HEAD on the
 * wrong branch still refuses every remaining branch *in that repository* and
 * says so once, and still says nothing about any other.
 *
 * **A row is answered even when this app is the thing that broke**, which is
 * the one status transition nothing else in the process can make. `setStatus`
 * is reachable only from here; `cancelBatch` and `cancelQueuedFor` touch
 * `queued` rows alone; and `reconcileMergeQueueOnBoot` needs a restart. So a
 * throw escaping this loop left the row it was on stuck at `landing` or
 * `resolving` for the life of the container — with `enqueue` then refusing that
 * run by name for ever, since `queuedRunIds` counts it as still in the queue,
 * and the panel pinning its batch as unfinished under a spinner. The operator
 * lands the branch by hand, it works, and the queue goes on saying `landing`.
 * That was reachable: `git()` documents that it never rejects and now holds to
 * it, but `landState`, `landRun` and `resolveConflicts` reach a database and a
 * spawn on every item, and none of them is total.
 *
 * The row is **failed rather than retried**, and the message says the merge may
 * have gone through: the throw can land after `landRun` has already committed
 * into the operator's checkout, and this is the same sentence the boot
 * reconciler gives a row it caught mid-merge, for the same reason — nothing
 * here saw the write finish, and inventing an answer is worse than naming the
 * uncertainty. It halts the repository for `planItem`'s reason: a fault in this
 * app will meet the branch behind this one identically, and each rediscovery is
 * another merge attempted into a directory a person owns.
 *
 * **A shutdown stops it taking the next row, and never touches the one in
 * flight.** It used to read nothing, so a drain under way at SIGTERM went on
 * calling `landRun`, a `git merge` into the operator's own checkout, for every
 * clean branch behind the current one, in a process that could exit part-way
 * through any of them and leave a row for the boot to call uncertain. The rows
 * it does not take stay `queued`, and `reconcileMergeQueueOnBoot` cancels them:
 * a queue never merges into somebody's checkout by itself, and the grace before
 * a restart is no more the operator's say-so than the boot after it.
 *
 * **The row already `landing` or `resolving` is waited for, and never
 * signalled.** Nothing on the landing path has a clock on its duration, and a
 * shutdown is not a reason to abort a merge part-way. But nothing waited for it
 * either: the shutdown's grace ended once the work cycles had settled, so a
 * SIGTERM mid-merge let the process exit under it, which under Docker kills the
 * `git merge` with PID 1 and can leave `MERGE_HEAD` in the operator's checkout.
 * The row is now held in `trackLand`'s set from the moment it is taken until
 * its status is written, and `shutdownRuns` waits for it inside the grace it
 * gives the loops, so it ends here in the normal way: a merge already running
 * finishes and lands, a `landRun` that had not yet begun its merge refuses
 * with the checkout untouched, and a resolution the ladder interrupts fails as
 * it would for any other reason. That grace is not a clock on the merge: it
 * signals nothing and fails nothing, and the process was exiting at that
 * signal whatever the merge was doing. Only a grace that runs out first leaves
 * the row for the boot, which fails it with the sentence it gives any row
 * caught mid-merge.
