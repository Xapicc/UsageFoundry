/**
 * The transcript with the chat's questions put back where they were asked.
 *
 * Pure and unit-tested, and the failure it exists against is silent in the
 * worst direction there is: a question the page never draws is a thread that
 * sits waiting for an operator who was never shown anything to answer, on a
 * page that looks entirely normal — no error, no empty state, nothing in the
 * console. The tail append is what makes that unreachable, and it is what the
 * test pins first.
 *
 * **A question is drawn before the operator's next message, not at its own
 * timestamp.** `ask_operator` records the row *during* the turn, so the
 * question's `createdAt` is minutes earlier than the reply that turn ends with
 * — placed by timestamp alone the card would sit above the sentence explaining
 * why it was being asked. Everything between the question and the operator's
 * next message is the rest of that turn, so the operator's next message is the
 * boundary: a pending question lands at the foot of the thread where the
 * composer is, and an answered one lands directly above the message that
 * carried the answer, which is what makes the pair read as asked-and-answered
 * rather than as a card that vanished.
 *
 * The comparison is **strict**, and that is the one part of this worth stating.
 * A question created in the same millisecond as a user message is the one that
 * message provoked — `sendChatMessage` appends the message and only then spawns
 * the child that asks — so `<=` would draw a question above the message that
 * caused it every time the two landed on one tick.
 *
 * `questions` must arrive oldest first, which is what `listQuestions` orders by
 * and what the DTO carries; nothing here re-sorts, because a page that sorted
 * would be a second opinion about an order the database already decides.

/**
 * The thread the page holds, brought up to date by what a poll answered with.
 *
 * The poll asks for the messages past the highest `seq` it holds, so what comes
 * back is a tail rather than a conversation — see `messagesFrom` on `ChatDTO`.
 * That field is the whole switch: above zero the answer is a tail and is
 * appended, at zero it is the thread and replaces what was there, which is what
 * a send, a cancel, an answer, a decision and the first load all return.
 *
 * Pure and unit-tested on `threadItems`' grounds, and against a failure of the
 * same kind: a merge that drops a message loses a paragraph out of the middle of
 * a conversation with nothing on the page to say so, and one that keeps a
 * duplicate says the model answered twice. Both look exactly like a normal
 * transcript.
 *
 * **The tail is filtered rather than trusted.** The interval fires whether or
 * not the last poll has answered, so two requests carrying the same cursor are
 * ordinary — the second one's answer overlaps the first's and everything at or
 * below what is already held has to go. That is also what makes the cursor safe
 * to advance only here: it moves when a message is merged and never when one is
 * merely asked for, so a slow answer that lands out of order cannot leave a hole
 * behind it.

/**
 * The instant the turn in flight began, which is what its clock counts from.

 * Pure and unit-tested on `threadItems`' grounds: every way of getting it wrong
 * draws a *duration* rather than an error — plausible, wrong, and on the one
 * line of the page an operator uses to decide whether to keep waiting or press
 * Stop and lose what the child has done. `turnStartedAt` is what `claimTurn`
 * wrote and what `staleTurn` measures the ten-minute deadline against, so
 * reading anything else here puts the elapsed time and the ceiling beside it on
 * two different turns. The thread was that anything else: a turn writes into it
 * — `save_template` appends a note mid-turn — and each write restarted the
 * clock at zero.
 *
 * `lastWrite` is `staleTurn`'s own fallback (`chat.ts:1671`) and is here for
 * its reason: a row claimed before the column existed carries no start instant,
 * and the last thing written to the thread is the nearest thing to one. Null
 * when there is neither, so the caller decides what to draw with no start
 * rather than being handed a zero that renders as the age of the epoch.
