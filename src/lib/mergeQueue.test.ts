/**
 * Covers the queue's two pure decisions and nothing else.
 *
 * `planItem` is what the worker does with one branch: whether to write into a
 * directory a person owns, whether to spend their money reconciling a branch
 * first, and whether the problem it just hit is one every branch behind this one
 * will hit too. Each of those is expensive to get wrong in a different way — a
 * merge nobody sanctioned, a billed resolution for a merge that was going to be
 * refused anyway, or ten identical refusals scrolling past because the queue
 * kept trying against a checkout that was never going to accept any of them.
 *
 * `selectQueueBatches` is what the operator can see and therefore stop. The
 * worker drains every queued row whatever batch it belongs to, so a batch left
 * out of this answer goes on merging into the operator's checkout with nothing
 * on the page naming it — and `cancelBatch` is scoped by `batch_id`, so a batch
 * the page cannot name is a batch nobody can cancel. Both failures are silent:
 * the page renders a shorter list, correctly, and says nothing about the merges
 * missing from it.
