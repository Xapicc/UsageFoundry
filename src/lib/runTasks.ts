/**
 * The background tasks a run started, read back out of the run's own log.
 *
 * Claude Code reports a backgrounded shell or agent through `system` events, and
 * `orchestrator.ts` already stores every one of them as a `log` event whose
 * message is `system:<subtype>` and whose `raw` is the CLI's whole event. Nothing
 * showed them: `logLine.ts` drops every `system:`-prefixed line from the feed on
 * purpose, so the task lifecycle was on every run's log and invisible on it at
 * the same time. This is the reader for those rows — the drop stays where it is,
 * because the feed is a transcript of the agent's turns and a task's five state
 * changes are a panel, not five more lines to scroll past.
 *
 * Derived here rather than recorded by the orchestrator for the reason
 * `cycles.ts` gives: the events are already on disk, so this reads a run that
 * finished before the panel existed.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe — no node builtins, and nothing imported but
 * `apiTypes.ts` — because it runs in the browser over the replayed event stream
 * and because `src/lib` is what `tsconfig.test.json` compiles.
 *
 * Sub-agent delegations are deliberately not here. A `Task` tool call has its own
 * `subagent` event kind and its own label in the log; folding it in would put a
 * delegated turn and a backgrounded shell under one word.
 */

 * this app has not seen: the outcome is terminal, the word is in `statusWord`,
 * and inventing a tone for it would be a claim about a status nobody here has
