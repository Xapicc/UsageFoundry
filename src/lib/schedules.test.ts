/**
 * The decision a schedule makes, and only that.
 *
 * It clears the same bar every other test here does — a pure function whose
 * failure modes are silent and expensive — and it clears it from both sides at
 * once, which is unusual. A schedule that fires a window twice bills twice, with
 * nobody present to notice; a schedule that never fires is bit-for-bit what a
 * working schedule looks like between occurrences, so the failure is invisible
 * until somebody asks why last week's work never happened.
 *
 * The zone cases are here for a third reason: the container runs in UTC and the
 * operator does not, so every wall-clock instant this computes is computed in a
 * zone the server is not in, and the two days a year that arithmetic is hard are
 * the two days nothing else in the app would catch.
