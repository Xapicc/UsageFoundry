/**
 * An Obsidian vault in one of the workspace mounts, read as a link graph.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * It is not a mount source. `WORKSPACE_ROOTS` is fixed at boot and this module
 * adds nothing to it: `knowledgeBaseMountId` **names** one of the mounts that
 * are already configured, exactly as `defaultAgentId` names a saved agent, and
 * a subpath narrows the walk to a directory inside it. So the vault is always
 * somewhere an agent could already have been pointed at, and nothing here can
 * widen what this container can read.
 *
 * It is also read-only, end to end. Nothing in this module or in the routes
 * over it opens a file for writing, creates a directory or removes one. That is
 * a deliberate bound rather than a stage not reached yet: the vault is a live
 * document store that a person edits in another application, and a background
 * index that can write into it is one that can lose somebody's paragraph while
 * they are typing it.
 *
 * ## Why the parse is hand-rolled
 *
 * There is no YAML dependency here and this does not add one — the runtime
 * dependency list is four packages and a frontmatter block is a small enough
 * grammar to read honestly. `parseFrontmatter` handles the subset Obsidian
 * itself writes and the subset this vault uses: flat and nested block mappings,
 * block sequences, inline flow sequences, quoted and bare scalars. Anything it
 * cannot classify is preserved as its own string rather than dropped, because
 * the payload promises arbitrary keys survive.
 *
 * ## Resolution is Obsidian's, and the order is the whole of it
 *
 * `[[Terraform State]]` names a note by *basename*, not by path, and this vault
 * has 759 of them in a four-deep tree — so a resolver that only matched paths
 * would report nearly every link in it as broken, which is a page full of red
 * that says nothing. The order in `resolveTarget` is therefore load-bearing and
 * is stated there rather than here.
 *
 * A target that resolves to nothing is recorded as a **broken link** and gets a
 * `phantom` node, never dropped. Dropping it is what turns "this vault has 340
 * dangling links" into a graph that reads as complete, which is the one reading
 * an operator would act on and the one that would be wrong.
 *
 * ## The cache is the point
 *
 * Reading 759 files per request is what this exists to avoid. The index is held
 * on `globalThis` (dev hot reload otherwise resets it on every request) and
 * every call re-walks the tree for *stat* only — `mtimeMs` and `size` per file
 * — and re-reads exactly the files whose stamp moved. A vault nobody has
 * touched since the last call costs one `readdir` per directory and no reads at
 * all.

 * broken on a page whose whole job is to say which links are broken.
 *
 * 1. **Basename.** `[[Terraform State]]` names a file, from anywhere in the
 *    vault, at any depth. This is how nearly every link in a real vault is
 *    written, which is why it is first.
 * 2. **Path, then shortest-unique suffix.** `[[Terraform/State]]` names a
 *    place; the suffix map means a link may write as much of the path as it
 *    takes to be unambiguous and no more.
 * 3. **Alias.** Last of the three, because a real file whose *name* is the
 *    target must beat a different note that merely answers to it — otherwise
 *    adding an alias to one note silently repoints every link to another.
 *
 * Ties inside a step go to the shortest path, which is Obsidian's own rule.
 *
 * A target with a non-note extension is tried as an attachment first, and a
 * miss there falls through to the notes with the whole key as the name.
 * `path.extname` cannot tell `diagram.png` from `Node.js HTTP Server
 * Documentation`, whose "extension" is `.js http server documentation`, and
 * stopping at the attachment miss is what made 705 of the 706 broken links on
 * the operator's vault name notes that exist.
