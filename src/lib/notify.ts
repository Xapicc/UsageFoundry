/**
 * One outbound POST when a run reaches an ending that needs a person.
 *
 * The problem it answers is
 * `git show a74a1bb:"proposals/implemented - UnattendedOperation/00-problem.md"`:
 * at twenty-five unattended runs, an ending that asks for somebody —
 * `needs-review`, a guard that stopped the run, a crash, the 17-26 minute 429
 * ladder — is visible on the run page, in `run_events` and on container stdout,
 * and in none of those places does it reach a person who is not already
 * looking. Every other option surveyed there needs somebody at a screen. This
 * one needs a receiver the operator already has.
 *
 * **It is vendor-neutral, and that is the whole of its security argument rather
 * than a preference.** One generic signed JSON body goes to one URL the operator
 * named. There is no format switch, no vendor branch and no per-vendor shape,
 * because the moment this file knows what Discord's body looks like, the
 * feature stops being "the operator points us at their own receiver" and becomes
 * "this app talks to third parties". The practical consequence is documented in
 * `docs/install.md` and is not a bug here: Discord's and Slack's incoming
 * webhooks accept only their own body (`{"content": …}` and `{"text": …}`), so a
 * bare Discord URL answers **400** and neither can be pointed at directly. Home
 * Assistant's `POST /api/webhook/<id>` takes arbitrary JSON and is the shaping
 * layer that fans out to whichever of those the operator wants.
 *
 * **Attached beside `logLifecycle` and reading the same `PersistedRunEvent`, on
 * purpose.** That function's projection is an already-reviewed decision about
 * what may leave this container — an `iteration` payload carries the whole
 * prompt and a creation `status` payload carries the folder — and a notifier
 * hung off a route or wrapped around `setStatus` would start that decision over
 * from nothing. What it costs is that this sink sees events rather than
 * transitions, which is why the filter below carries the small amount of state
 * it does.
 */

/**
 * Exactly what goes on the wire, and the list is closed.
 *
 * Six fields, every one of them either an id this app minted, a status from a
 * fixed vocabulary, a clock reading, or a string the *operator* wrote in the
 * environment. The standard is `status.ts`'s, one notch stricter: a webhook body
 * is retained and forwarded by whatever receives it, and unlike `/api/status` it
 * travels to a host this app does not control.
 *
 * **`runs.title` must never be added to this, and it is named here so that
 * refusing it is a decision somebody already took.** A title is model-writable
 * text: `chat.ts` lets a proposal name its own run, so a title is the one field
 * on that row an agent can put arbitrary characters into, and putting it here
 * would send an unattended model's prose to a third-party endpoint. The same
 * refusal covers the task text, the folder path, the branch name, the repository,
 * the model, the cost, the diff and `needs_review_reason` — the run's own page
 * is where those are read, and `url` is how a person gets there.

 *    cancel emits no `budget` event at all, so it can never be marked — which is
 *    the whole point, and is a great deal safer than parsing `stop_reason`, which
 *    is user-facing prose and the one thing here that must never become a parse.
 *  - The 429 ladder retries in place and emits one `error` per rung, four rungs
 *    over ~17-26 minutes. The first rung is the news; the rest are the wait the
 *    first one already announced.
 *
 * `globalThis`-pinned under its own key for the reason every other long-lived
 * singleton here is: module state silently resets on every request under
 * `next dev`, and a latch that resets is not a latch.

 * `refusalDisposition` answers an allowance refusal with `park` or `fail` and
 * never `retry`, so `retrying` is true exactly when `usageLimit` is false.
 * Implemented literally it would be a channel that never fires for this
 * option's headline row — the cousin of that survey's own failure mode 3. So the
 * test is `retrying === true`, which is every in-place retry: the 429 ladder and
 * the ~85-second transient ladder both, indistinguishable from here because the
 * payload carries no `refusalKind`. Adding one to the emit site is the one-line
