/**
 * Covers one thing: which unsettled blocks a restart closes out.
 *
 * `reconcileOnBoot` keeps a run that is `paused` inside `resumeGraceHours`,
 * because it is a run the operator started in a mode chosen precisely so it
 * would carry on across a restart. `reconcileBlocksOnBoot` then used to write
 * *every* `waiting` block `blocked`, so the tail of that run's own workflow was
 * destroyed by the same boot that went out of its way to preserve its head —
 * and the sentence recorded on the row said the block in front of it "was
 * closed out by the same restart", which was a statement about a run that was
 * still parked and about to resume.
 *
 * The `looping` sweep in the same function asked no such question for longer,
 * and the parked run there is the loop's own current pass: the row went
 * `failed`, `advanceLoops` selects `looping` so no further pass was ever
 * created, and `loopVerdict`'s `failed` arm then wrote every successor
 * `blocked` while that pass was still committing to the branch they were
 * waiting for.
 *
 * It earns a place in this suite on this suite's terms. `bootBlockPlan` is the
 * decision and is unit-tested beside the other pure ones in `workflows.test.ts`;
 * what is left over is a *join* across three tables and an ordering between two
 * reconcilers, which is not something there is an argument to hand a function.
 * Every way of getting it wrong typechecks, throws nothing and renders as an
 * ordinary blocked block — the only evidence is a merge that never lands weeks
 * of work, months after the restart that decided it.
 *
 * Its own file, and `DATA_DIR` set before the first import, for the reason
 * `haltedMembers.test.ts` and `chatTurn.test.ts` are: `config.ts` reads that
 * variable at module load and `orchestrator.ts` pulls it in statically, so a
 * file that imported either at the top would already be bound to the
 * repository's own `.data` directory — which on a developer's machine is the
 * real one. Its own file rather than a case in `haltedMembers.test.ts` for a
 * second reason as well: both reconcilers here act on *every* row in the
 * database, so they would close out that file's fixtures under it.
