/**
 * The file price list, and the two ways it can be worse than not shipping it.
 *
 * Both are silent, which is the bar `docs/agent/testing.md` sets, and neither
 * shows up in a typecheck, a smoke test or the run's own log.
 *
 * **Drift is the expensive one.** This text joins `--append-system-prompt`,
 * which is part of the cached prefix, so a version of it that produced different
 * bytes for the same inputs would cold-start every token behind it on the next
 * cycle of the same run. The run still works. It just costs several dollars a
 * cycle more than it did, for a notice worth a few cents.
 * `runs.file_cost_notice` is what freezes it across cycles; what is asserted
 * here is the other half — that the generator itself carries no order-dependence
 * and no clock, so freezing a *deterministic* function is what that column is
 * actually doing.
 *
 * **Bloat is the quiet one.** Every character here is re-read on every turn of
 * every cycle, so a repository with very long paths has to cost the run a
 * shorter list rather than a bigger prompt — and a notice that grew past its
 * budget would look exactly like one that did not.
 *
 * The rest of the file pins the degradations, because the alternative to a price
 * list is not a broken run: it is the run this app spawned last week. Every
 * failure has to land there rather than on a half-built list, or on a throw at
 * the one door every run in this app comes through.
