/**
 * Which uid the children run as, and why it is not the server's.
 *
 * Everything this app spawns — the work cycle, the reviewer, the chat, an
 * orchestrator block's turn, and every git this app runs on its own behalf —
 * used to run as the same uid as the server. That made three separate defences
 * decorative at once, because all three are file modes and a mode says nothing
 * to the process that owns the file:
 *
 *   - `childEnv` deletes `UF_*`, `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY` and `DATA_DIR` from the
 *     child's environment, and `/proc/<server pid>/environ` handed every one of
 *     them straight back. That file is mode 0400 owned by the *server's* uid,
 *     so the strip is enforceable exactly when the child is a different uid.
 *   - `/data` held the database, the settings the guards read and the lock
 *     `serverLock.ts` uses to decide whether a second writer exists. An agent
 *     that can write it can rewrite a budget, a status or a permission mode
 *     with no HTTP request and no token.
 *   - the MCP capability file is written 0600, which excludes nobody at all
 *     when the reader is the owner.
 *
 * So the container starts as root and the server stays root, while every child
 * is dropped to `UF_AGENT_UID`/`UF_AGENT_GID` — which compose fills from the
 * operator's own `UF_UID`/`UF_GID`, i.e. the uid that owns the bind mounts.
 * That direction is forced rather than chosen. The child must be the uid that
 * owns the workspace, because an isolated run is *ordered* to commit and its
 * commits land in the operator's own `<repo>/.git`; and the server must be able
 * to read `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, which the CLI keeps at 0600 owned by
 * that same uid. Two processes, one of which must be the mount owner and the
 * other of which must out-rank it: the server is therefore root, and the
 * privileged half is the one this app wrote rather than the twenty-five
 * unattended agents reading repository content nobody here reviewed.
 *
 * What this does *not* buy is written down beside it in `docs/security.md`: the
 * child is still the uid that owns `~/.claude`, so a work cycle can still read
 * the account's own OAuth credential — it has to, that credential is what it
 * bills against.
 *
 * **The third defence needed a second cut, and it is a gid rather than a uid.**
 * Moving the MCP capability file out of `/tmp` closed enumeration and nothing
 * else: `--mcp-config <path>` is an argv element, `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is
 * world-readable, and a work-cycle agent that reads the path out of a sibling's
 * command line was handed a file its own uid owned. A second *uid* for the chat
 * would need a second Claude credential to authenticate as, which a
 * subscription install does not have. A second *gid* needs nothing: the chat and
 * block child keeps `UF_AGENT_UID`, so it still bills against the same account
 * and still writes the operator's files as the uid they expect, while the
 * per-turn directory and file are handed to `UF_CHAT_GID` and mode 0710/0040 —
 * so a work-cycle agent fails the owner check (root), fails the group check (it
 * is not in that group), and is left with the "other" bits, which are zero.
 * `resolveChatGid` is that decision, and it is separate from the pair above
 * because it is inert on its own: a gid sharpens a boundary the uid split makes,
 * and without that split there is nothing to sharpen.
 *
 * Inert unless the server is actually root. `npm run dev` on a laptop, the test
 * suite, and a container an operator has pinned back to `user: "1000:1000"` all
 * get today's behaviour, because `setuid` needs a privilege none of them has.
 * The last of those three is a *silent* loss of a boundary, which is the shape
 * of failure this codebase refuses to ship, so it is the one case that throws:
 * an environment that names an agent uid the process cannot switch to is a
 * misconfiguration, not a degradation.
