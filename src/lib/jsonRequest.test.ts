/**
 * Every page here reports a failed request by rendering a sentence, and there
 * are two ways to end up rendering nothing at all. `fetch` rejects on a dropped
 * connection, a restarting container or a proxy blip, and a handler that never
 * catches it leaves the page exactly as it was — the press did nothing visible,
 * which is what a press that did nothing also looks like. A response that is
 * unsuccessful, or successful and not JSON, is the same failure arriving by the
 * other door.
 *
 * So what this pins is that the function *returns*, in every one of those
 * cases, carrying enough to say which happened: `status: null` is nobody
 * answered, a number is somebody refused. The callers need that split because
 * they render different copy for it — `pollFailureMessage(null, …)` on a poll,
 * and a sentence about a request that may or may not have been carried out on a
 * Land, a Purge or a Delete, which is the one press here with no undo.
