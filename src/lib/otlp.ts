/**
 * Receiver for Claude Code's own OpenTelemetry export.
 *
 * Claude Code computes a cost for every API request and will push it to any
 * OTLP/HTTP endpoint. That is a first-party number: it needs no price table,
 * no `${message.id}:${requestId}` dedupe, and no byte-offset file reads. It is
 * strictly a *complement* to the transcript scan, never a replacement — it
 * cannot backfill history, carries no `cwd`, and collapses the 5m/1h cache
 * split that `pricing.ts` weights 1.25x against 2x. `scanUsage()` remains the
 * only input to the windows, and to every guard except one: `telemetrySpendSince`
 * feeds the mid-cycle half of a run's *own* spend under live enforcement, which
 * is the single figure no other source produces before a cycle ends. See the
 * comment on that function.
 *
 * Shapes here were taken from a captured POST from CLI v2.1.226, not from the
 * documentation, which disagrees on one detail that matters: the docs call the
 * event `claude_code.api_request`, and that string is indeed the log record's
 * *body* — but the `event.name` attribute holds the bare `api_request`. Both
 * are accepted below so a change on either side does not silently stop
 * matching.

/**
 * What lets one run's exporter reach the ingest route, and nothing else.
 *
 * The exporter used to authenticate with `UF_AUTH_TOKEN`, put into the agent's
 * own environment as `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` — the app's master credential,
 * handed to a Claude Code session with `Bash`, in a variable `env` prints. That
 * contradicted the rule stated directly above `childEnv`, which strips `UF_*`
 * from every child precisely because that token opens every route in the app:
 * `POST /api/runs`, `PUT /api/settings`, every other run's diff, the approval
 * route, branch deletion.
 *
 * This is `chat.ts`'s capability applied to a narrower subject. 32 random bytes,
 * held in memory, compared in constant time against every live token rather than
 * looked up by key (a `Map.get` on a secret leaks its prefix through timing),
 * and it opens exactly one thing: writing telemetry records *for its own run*.
 * The route takes the run id from the token, so a record claiming another run's
 * `uf.run_id` cannot move spend onto it.
 *
 * On `globalThis` for the reason every other long-lived singleton here is —
 * `next dev` would otherwise re-evaluate the module and invalidate a live run's
 * credential mid-cycle. It never outlives the process, so nothing recovered from
 * a captured environment after a restart ingests anything.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no** expiry while a run is live. A run may last hours,
 * and a token that timed out would stop telemetry arriving with nothing to say
 * so — which is a live spending guard silently reading zero, the exact failure
 * `needsLiveSpendTelemetry` exists to prevent. It is revoked when the run's loop
 * ends instead, on a short grace: the exporter batches on a one-second timer, so
 * revoking on the instant would drop the tail of the last cycle and understate
 * the run.
