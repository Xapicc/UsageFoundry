/**
 * The ledger's two bookkeeping rules, both of which were wrong until a smoke
 * test against the real corpus caught them, and both of which fail silently.
 *
 * A night that wrote six notes read back as `quiet`, so the one surface that
 * shows this feature reported a night that touched somebody's vault as a night
 * that did nothing. And a second pass in the same calendar night had its
 * report's item numbers mapped onto the *first* pass's signatures, attaching a
 * real file path to a row about a different failure — two rows that both look
 * right, with only the pairing wrong.
 *
 * Its own file with `DATA_DIR` named before the first import, for
 * `runOrigin.test.ts`'s reason: `config.ts` is read at module load, so a file
 * that imported the ledger at the top would already be bound to the
 * repository's own `.data` — which on a developer's machine is the real one.
