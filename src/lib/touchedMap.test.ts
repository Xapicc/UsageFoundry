/**
 * Covers the three things on the map that have a decidable answer.
 *
 * Everything here fails silently and draws a plausible picture instead of
 * throwing. A path filed under the wrong parent puts `src/lib/db.ts` in a
 * cluster labelled `docs` and the operator reads a repository that does not
 * exist. A fold that loses a file is the one thing this surface promises never
 * to do — it is a picture, so a missing node is not a missing row somebody would
 * notice, and the count beside it would still be printed with confidence. And
 * the three ways of having nothing all render as an empty canvas, which reads as
 * a run that touched no file at all: `swept` is a retention policy, `idle` is a
 * run that used `Bash` for everything, and an absent diff is an *unknown*
 * changed set that no node may draw a "changed" mark for.
 *
 * The drawing is deliberately not tested. A canvas has no DOM here, and an
 * assertion over a colour or a radius would be a restatement of the code rather
 * than a check on it; `canvasView.test.ts` already holds the arithmetic that
 * would draw a wrong picture without saying so.
