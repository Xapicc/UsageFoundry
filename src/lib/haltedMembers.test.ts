/**
 * Covers two things about one join, and the second is the first turned around.
 *
 * A halted workflow's members stay halted; and a member picked up again asks
 * afresh about everything it blocked — including the half of a graph that is not
 * runs at all. Both are decided by joining `runs` (or
 * `workflow_instance_blocks`) to `workflow_instances` through
 * `workflow_instance_runs`, and every way of getting either wrong typechecks,
 * throws nothing, and looks identical on the page.
 *
 * ## The halt
 *
 * `stopInstance` writes `blocked` onto every member that was still `waiting`,
 * and such a row has `work_dir` null and `iterations` 0 — which is bit for bit
 * the candidate set `reviveBlockedDependents` selects and the shape `reopenRun`
 * accepts through its `waitingAgain` branch. Neither looked at the workflow, so
 * pressing Try again on a halted member, or reopening the stopped run in front
 * of it, put agents back to work under an instance whose page says "Stopped" —
 * with the instance budget guard unable to stop them again, since it acts only
 * on an instance that is `started`.
 *
 * It earns a place in this suite on this suite's terms: every way of getting it
 * wrong typechecks, throws nothing, and looks identical on the page — the only
 * evidence is a billed agent nobody asked for. And it is a test about a join
 * across three tables, so unlike the pure decisions beside it there is no
 * argument to hand a function; the database is the subject.
 *
 * ## The pick-up
 *
 * A node deferred behind an orchestrator or a merge block is not a run: it holds
 * a row in `workflow_instance_blocks` until `advanceInstance` turns it into one,
 * and `planInstanceStep` skips any such row that does not say `waiting`. So a
 * predecessor that ended in a way its edge could not accept wrote that row
 * `blocked` and nothing ever put it back — reopening the predecessor woke the
 * *runs* behind it and left the ledger alone, so the instance ran to the end of
 * its graph with the tail missing and the row still naming an ending the
 * operator had since undone. The database is the subject here for the same
 * reason: the gate is a stored status, so the pure `planInstanceStep` cases
 * beside it cannot see this at all.
 *
 * Its own file, and `DATA_DIR` set before the first import, for the reason
 * `chatOrder.test.ts` and `chatTurn.test.ts` are: `config.ts` reads that
 * variable at module load and `orchestrator.ts` pulls it in statically, so a
 * file that imported either at the top would already be bound to the
 * repository's own `.data` directory — which on a developer's machine is the
 * real one. `node --test` gives each file its own process; the assertion in
 * `before` is what makes a change to that fail loudly.
