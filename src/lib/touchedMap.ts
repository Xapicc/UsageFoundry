/**
 * What a run touched, arranged by where in the repository it sits.
 *
 * The arrangement itself is `pathMap.ts` and knows nothing about touches; what
 * is here is the payload — what a call log can say about one file, and what a
 * directory says about the files under it.
 *
 * **The node set is files, and the arrangement is the path hierarchy.** The
 * obvious graph over this data is tool → file, and it is the wrong one at every
 * size: a dozen tool hubs with nearly every file hanging off `Read` is a star,
 * and a star draws one fact — that the run read a lot — which is a fact the
 * count above the table already states. `src/lib/` against `docs/agent/` is a
 * question with a spatial answer; "what did `Read` touch" is not. So tool
 * identity is an *attribute* here (`TouchedFile.tools`, and the union of them on
 * a directory) and never a node, and the edges are containment rather than
 * causation.
 *
 * Two consequences worth stating, because both are invisible if they go wrong:
 *
 * - **Nothing here says a touch succeeded.** `reconcileTouches` is upstream of
 *   this file and its rows are attempts; this module adds no field that could be
 *   read as an outcome. `state` distinguishes read from written from both, which
 *   is what the call *asked for*, not what it got.
 * - **A file is never dropped.** That is `pathMap.ts`'s rule and the reason the
 *   fold there is a depth cutoff rather than `capGraph`'s degree-first prune,
 *   but it is this map's promise: the surface prints the folded count out loud.
 *
 * **This module reaches nothing** — the same rule `runTouches.ts` states, and
 * for the same reason: the page that draws the map is a `"use client"` file and
 * imports it, so one server import would follow `node:fs` into the browser
 * bundle. It also lives in `src/lib` because that is what `tsconfig.test.json`
 * compiles, and every failure mode below is silent: a tree that files a path
 * under the wrong parent draws a plausible picture of a repository that does not
 * exist.

 * the SessionFlow proposal recorded a tool → file graph as *structurally unable*
 * to show, because a file with no event has no edge to any tool. Laid out by
 * path it has a position like everything else.
