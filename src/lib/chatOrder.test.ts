/**
 * Covers the order `listMessages` returns a thread in, and the order the two
 * proposal reads return cards in (the last describe), and nothing else.
 *
 * It earns a test on the same grounds as the rest of this suite: it is wrong in
 * a way that throws nothing, typechecks, and changes what the operator is told.
 * `finishTurn` appends the reply, an error and a denial note inside one
 * synchronous block, so all three carry the same `Date.now()`; the query used to
 * break that tie with `id`, which is a random UUID. Half the time the thread
 * therefore rendered "Refused tool calls this turn" *above* the reply it is a
 * footnote to, which reads as "the tool was refused, and separately here is an
 * answer" rather than "here is the answer, and a tool was refused producing it".
 * Observed on the live database, not reasoned about.
 *
 * This is the one test here that opens a database, because the defect is in the
 * SQL. That is also why it is its own file rather than a case in
 * `chat.test.ts`: `config.ts` reads `DATA_DIR` at module load, and that file
 * imports `./chat` statically, so by the time any test body ran the path would
 * already be bound to the repository's own `.data` directory — which on a
 * developer's machine is the real one.
