/**
 * What a `Read` of this repository's largest files costs, told to the agent
 * *before* it reads one.
 *
 * ## Why this is worth spending tokens on
 *
 * Measured over this machine's own transcripts — 1,209 files, 49,885 deduped
 * turns, $6,626 over 12.4 days, priced through `pricing.ts` — the bill splits
 * **60.7% cache read, 26.3% cache write, 12.9% output and 0.1% input**. Six
 * sevenths of what this fleet spends is carrying context rather than generating
 * anything, and `DELEGATION_NOTICE` next door states the mechanism: nothing
 * shrinks a main thread, so a file read on turn 12 is paid for again on every
 * turn after it. The share of that re-read bill attributable to `Read`
 * specifically — about two fifths, from the replay this feature was proposed on
 * — is *not* re-measured here, so treat the size of the win as an estimate and
 * the direction as measured.
 *
 * The individual numbers are the argument. `src/lib/orchestrator.ts` in this
 * repository is about 116,000 tokens and this fleet read it 496 times across 78
 * runs; `src/lib/workflows.ts` is 68,000 over 185 reads; `docs/verification.md`
 * 57,000 over 75. One avoided full read of the first is worth about $3.19 — the
 * read itself, the roughly 35 later turns that re-read it at the cache rate, and
 * the 1h cache write behind it. This notice costs about 400 tokens on every turn
 * of every cycle, which is roughly $7 across a corpus that size. Avoiding one
 * read in ten pays for it about twenty times over.
 *
 * An agent cannot price a file it has not opened, and nothing in the CLI tells
 * it. This app can: it has the repository on disk and it has `run_events`, which
 * records every tool call this fleet has ever made with its input. So the price
 * list is something only the supervisor can write, which is why it is written
 * here rather than left to a habit the model is asked to acquire.
 *
 * ## Why it is frozen on the run's row, and why that is not an optimisation
 *
 * **The appended system prompt is part of the cached prefix.** If this text
 * differed between cycle 1 and cycle 2 of the same run, every token behind it
 * would be cold on cycle 2 — and on a 190,000-token context that is far more
 * than the notice could ever save. This feature is a net *loss* the moment the
 * text drifts within a run.
 *
 * Two things make it drift if it is recomputed per cycle, and both are certain
 * rather than hypothetical: the read counts below move as the fleet works, and
 * the file sizes move as this very run edits files. So it is generated **once**,
 * when the run is created, and stored on `runs.file_cost_notice` — the treatment
 * `runs.agent` gets and for a related reason, that a run's later cycles must be
 * given exactly what its first cycle was given. Every cycle then puts the
 * *stored* text on the argv.
 *
 * Do not "improve" this into a per-cycle recomputation. A fresher list is worth
 * a few cents; a cold prefix costs dollars per cycle, and nothing about the run
 * would look wrong while it happened.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It names no command. `SELF_HOSTING_NOTICE` records what happens when a literal
 * on the appended prompt is *offered as a pattern*: a port number in a worked
 * `pgrep -f` example matched every sibling agent, because that string is on
 * every sibling's command line. The paths here are the same kind of shared
 * literal — every run on this repository carries them — so the property that
 * makes them safe is that nothing here suggests selecting a process with one.
 * They are repo-relative, they sit in a price list, and no verb near them is
 * `kill`. The case named "offers no literal as a thing to run" in
 * `fileCostNotice.test.ts` pins that, and `SELF_HOSTING_NOTICE`'s own sentence
 * about literals is scoped to the whole appended prompt, so it already covers
 * this half.
