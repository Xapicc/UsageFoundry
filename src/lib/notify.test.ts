/**
 * Covers the two halves of the outbound webhook that decide anything, and
 * nothing else in that file.
 *
 * Both are pure and both fail silently, which is the bar this suite is built to.
 * The filter is the one
 * `git show a74a1bb:"proposals/implemented - UnattendedOperation/12-validation.md"`
 * names as this feature's own failure mode: too wide and the channel is noise,
 * which is how an operator stops reading it; too narrow and it is a channel
 * that looks configured and never fires, which is indistinguishable from a
 * fleet with nothing wrong — and neither direction throws, fails to typecheck
 * or shows on any page. There is no place in the UI where a missed notification
 * is visible.
 *
 * The signature fails the other way and once for everybody: a receiver verifying
 * the HMAC rejects every POST, and the symptom is a channel that delivers 400s
 * for ever with the app reporting the delivery attempted. The vectors are
 * therefore **frozen hex**, computed once and pasted, rather than recomputed here
 * from `node:crypto` — a test that recomputes the answer with the same call the
 * code makes passes whatever that call does, and what has to stay fixed is the
 * bytes on the wire.
