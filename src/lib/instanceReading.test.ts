/**
 * What `instanceStatus` is handed, which is a count over two tables.
 *
 * The decision itself is pure and tested beside `haltPlan`; this is the half of
 * it that no pure function can reach — a graph is half runs and half a ledger of
 * blocks that are not runs yet, and "is anything still live" has to be asked of
 * both. Counting only the runs is the failure this exists to have none of, and
 * it is the quiet one: a node deferred behind an orchestrator block holds a
 * `waiting` row in `workflow_instance_blocks` and nothing else, so an instance
 * whose runs have all settled reads as *finished* while a block is still to
 * wake — and when it does wake, hours later, it starts a billed agent under a
 * page that already told the operator this press of Run was over.
 *
 * The mirror of it is the same shape one status along: a member written off
 * because the block in front of it satisfied nothing is what separates a graph
 * that reached its end from one missing its tail, and it too can be either a run
 * or a ledger row. Reported as `finished`, a workflow that did half its work
 * reads exactly like one that did all of it.
 *
 * Its own file, and `DATA_DIR` set before the first import, for the reason
 * `haltedMembers.test.ts` is: `config.ts` reads that variable at module load, so
 * a file that imported anything at the top would already be bound to the
 * repository's own `.data` directory — which on a developer's machine is the
 * real one.
