/**
 * The generated vault-lookup skill.
 *
 * Every failure mode in this file is silent, which is the bar
 * `docs/agent/testing.md` sets — and here it is silent twice over. A SKILL.md
 * whose frontmatter does not parse is not loaded by the CLI at all: the spawn
 * succeeds, the argv is right, the debug log says one plugin was found and
 * nothing says the skill was rejected. And a SKILL.md that *is* loaded but has
 * lost the vault path, or the instruction to stop when the vault cannot be
 * read, produces a run that answers from its own knowledge in the vault's name
 * — which is indistinguishable, from anywhere downstream, from a run that
 * consulted the vault and agreed with itself. Neither shows up in a typecheck,
 * a smoke test, or the run's own log.
 *
 * What is asserted is therefore the *contract with the reader*, not the prose:
 * the frontmatter's shape, that the resolved path is present verbatim, which
 * of the two search branches was taken, and the two instructions the feature
 * would be actively harmful without.
