/**
 * Covers one thing: that a work cycle whose child stops producing output is
 * ended by this process rather than held until the container is restarted.
 *
 * It earns its place on the same grounds as `chat.ts`'s `settleOnExit` case,
 * and for a stronger version of that reason: the fault *is* the child.
 * `runIteration` registers `exit` and `close` and settles on nothing else, so a
 * `claude` wedged on a socket read leaves its promise pending for the life of
 * the process — every run row, folder claim, checkout slot and concurrency slot
 * it holds with it. A stubbed emitter standing in for the child would pin the
 * wiring to whatever it was written against rather than to what a real process
 * does, so what this drives is a real child that prints nothing and does not
 * exit, and what it asserts is that the promise settles at all.
 *
 * The bound is the test's own `timeout`. Without one the only failure available
 * here is "this test never returns", which is not a failure anything reports.
 *
 * It is its own file for `chatTurn.test.ts`'s reason and one of its own.
 * `DATA_DIR` and `CLAUDE_HOME` are read into `config.ts` at load, so they have
 * to be set before anything requires it — and this is the one file in the suite
 * that points `CLAUDE_BIN` at a binary that exists. That is deliberate, and it
 * is why this cannot be a case in `orchestrator.test.ts`, which pins that
 * variable at a path that does not exist precisely so a regression reaching a
 * spawn is a failed test rather than a billed one. The binary here is
 * `process.execPath` — this same Node, running an inline script — so nothing in
 * this file can reach Anthropic or spend anything.
 *
 * The two pure halves of the same decision — `cycleSilenceMs`, which narrows
 * the configured value, and `interruptOutcome`, which decides what the run ends
 * as — are cases in `orchestrator.test.ts` beside every other pure function,
 * because only the harness is what separates these files.

 * A child that prints nothing and stays alive, with its own way out.

 * The self-exit is a backstop rather than part of the subject: it is far longer
 * than the deadline and than the kill ladder, so a cycle that reaches it has
 * failed the test — the assertion on `exitCode` is what says which of the two
 * ended it — and it is what stops a failing run from leaking a detached process
 * into whatever is running these tests.
