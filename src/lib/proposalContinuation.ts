/**
 * The proposal of this chat already set to carry on `label`'s branch, or null.
 *
 * Two runs cannot extend one branch, and `admitDependencies` is what actually
 * refuses it: against the live `runs` table, when the operator clicks Approve,
 * naming two run ids that were on no card — and it also catches a proposal
 * continuing a run this chat never proposed, which nothing here can see. This
 * is the earlier half rather than a replacement. `propose_run` refuses the
 * second proposal as it is written, in the labels the model chose, for the
 * reason that whole function is deliberately stricter than it has to be.
 *
 * Only a **pending** rival counts, and both halves of that matter. A rejected
 * or failed proposal never became a run and holds no branch — the reading the
 * two checks beside this one already take of a decided proposal. An *approved*
 * one is deliberately not counted either, and that is the half worth writing
 * down: its run may have been refused at the door with no work cycle behind it,
 * which `admitDependencies` reads as leaving the branch free, so counting it
 * here would refuse a chain the approval would have allowed.
 *
 * The scan is over every proposal of the chat rather than only the labelled
 * ones, because a rival needs no label of its own to claim a branch — a model
 * naming ids only for the proposals something points *at* writes exactly that
 * shape, and it is the case a scan of `labels` alone would miss entirely.
 *
 * A pending rival under the condition `edgesExclude` pairs with `edge` is no
 * rival, for the reason `continuationRival` lets its waiting twin through: a
 * pending proposal has no run yet, so it is as unreleased as a run can be, and
 * only one of an on-success and an on-failure run behind the same predecessor
 * can ever start.
