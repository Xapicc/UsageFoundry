/**
 * What a running run says about the work cycle it has open.
 *
 * It earns a test on the same grounds as the rest of this repo's short list:
 * the failure is silent, typechecks, and is expensive to the reader. `iterations`
 * counts cycles that *finished*, so a run tens of minutes into cycle 1 reads
 * `0/N` — bit-for-bit what a run that was marked running and never started
 * reads, which is the exact question an operator opens the page to answer. The
 * two ways of getting this wrong are saying nothing (the bug) and trusting the
 * column on a row that is no longer running (a finished run that claims to be
 * working, which is the same lie pointing the other way).
