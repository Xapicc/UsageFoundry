   * `--permission-mode` stay three, the two routes to it stay two, and
   * `guardsFor` still returns the same three fields.

   * **It is the node's own and is never inherited from its template**, which is
   * the mount and folder's rule rather than the prompt's. What decides it is
   * what a template answers *here*: the run form applies one as a seed for every
   * field, where a node reads one for exactly three things — its guards, the
   * standing instructions `promptOverride` replaces, and the model. The model
   * joined that list when `run_templates` grew one, and it belongs there on the
   * ground that keeps it off this field: it moves cost and never capability, and
   * a node has no model of its own for it to override. It supplies neither the
   * mount nor the folder, for the stated reason that a template edited months
   * later would silently move a saved block's run to another repository, and an
   * agent is the same shape of change one field over: it decides who does the
   * work, it points into a registry that is edited somewhere else entirely, and
   * a saved graph whose agent moved with nothing in the graph changing is
   * exactly that surprise. The canvas states this field in the sentence a press
   * of Run is approved against, which it could not do honestly for a value that
   * lives on another record.
   *
   * An **id** rather than a copy, which is `run_templates.agent_id`'s rule and
   * the opposite of `runs.agent`'s, for that pair's reason: a saved graph is
   * form input applied again and again, so an operator who fixes their
   * reviewer's prompt expects the next press of Run to use the fixed one. The
   * copy is taken where it always is — `createRun` freezes the whole definition
   * onto the run — so an agent deleted between two blocks of one instance
   * cannot reach a run that has already started.
   *
   * Which child it is differs by kind, and the field does not. On a run block it
   * is what that run itself is started as. On an orchestrator block it is the
   * **deciding turn's**, because that turn is the child this block spawns; the runs it
   * emits name their own, one per spec, which is the only per-run answer
   * available to a block that has not decided on them yet. That is the opposite
   * way round from `promptOverride`, which an orchestrator block holds on behalf
   * of the runs it emits — standing instructions are what a run is *asked*, and
