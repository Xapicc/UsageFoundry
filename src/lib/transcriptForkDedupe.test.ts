/**
 * Which copy of a tool call wins when the same conversation is on disk twice.
 *
 * `winnow fork`, which this app ran until 2026-11-08, wrote a second transcript
 * whose tool results are deliberately replaced by short pointers, and never
 * deleted the first; those pairs stay on disk until retention takes them. Both files then carry
 * the same `tool_use` ids, so the composition reading has to pick one — and the
 * rule it used, most characters wins, always picked the original's full result.
 * The fork was reported as having removed nothing, permanently, on the one
 * screen an operator would look at to decide whether forking was worth it.
 * Measured on a real fork: 92,498 characters against the fork's own 69,773.
 *
 * The rule is now recency: a transcript still being appended to is the
 * conversation the run is carrying. Both directions are pinned here, because
 * the failure is invisible either way — the number is plausible whichever copy
 * wins, and nothing throws.
 *
 * Its own file, and `CLAUDE_HOME` is set before `transcripts` is imported:
 * `config.ts` reads that variable at module load, so a test that imported the
 * module first would scan the operator's real transcripts.
