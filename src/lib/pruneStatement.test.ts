/**
 * Covers the resolver that decides what the two context-control surfaces say
 * when there is no money to show.
 *
 * It earns a test on `paybackTurns`' grounds, transposed from arithmetic to
 * copy: **every way of getting this wrong renders a confident, well-formed
 * sentence.** Five distinct facts — pruning switched off, winnow missing from
 * the image, nothing worth removing, every boundary declined, and a run that
 * simply has not reached a boundary yet — shared one blank before this, and a
 * blank reads as "the feature did nothing". A resolver that returns the wrong
 * branch does not throw, does not fail to typecheck, and does not look broken;
 * it tells an operator something untrue in a complete English sentence, on the
 * one page built to say whether context control earns its keep.
 *
 * The sum case is the load-bearing one. The clause list is built by filtering
 * zeroes out, so a clause dropped by a typo produces a *shorter* sentence that
 * is still grammatical and still adds up to a plausible story — the failure the
 * `boundaries` denominator exists to make visible.
