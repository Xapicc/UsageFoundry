/**
 * Covers the two shipped scripts that copy this database and put it back.
 *
 * It is neither a pure function nor a rendering, and it earns its place the way
 * `deployment.test.ts` does — on a failure that is silent, expensive and
 * invisible to everything else here. The database is opened in WAL mode, so the
 * committed state is spread across three files and the backup an operator
 * reaches for first — `docker cp` of `usagefoundry.db`, or a `tar` of `/data` —
 * omits every transaction since the last checkpoint. The restored file opens
 * cleanly, passes `integrity_check`, and is simply missing the newest runs.
 * There is no assertion available anywhere else in this repository that tells
 * that apart from a good backup, and nobody looks at a backup until the day the
 * volume is gone.
 *
 * So the subject is the real database and the real scripts, driven as an
 * operator drives them: a snapshot taken while another connection holds a write
 * transaction open, restored into a directory standing in for a fresh volume,
 * and compared table by table against the source once it is quiesced. The four
 * refusals beside it are the ones that turn a restore into a second incident —
 * restoring under a live server, whether or not its heartbeat is still moving
 * (which corrupts rather than replaces), losing the database that was there,
 * restoring some other SQLite file, and a prune that deletes the wrong thing.
 *
 * `DATA_DIR` is set before the first import for `chatTurn.test.ts`'s reason:
 * `config.ts` reads it at module load, and this file needs the real `migrate()`
 * so the schema it round-trips is the shipped one rather than a hand-written
 * imitation of it. `node --test` gives each file its own process; the assertion
 * in `before` is what makes a change to that fail loudly instead of backing up
 * the developer's own database.
