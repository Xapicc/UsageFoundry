/**
 * Covers which directory a conflict resolution is given, and only that.
 *
 * Not a pure function, and it cannot be one: the fault it is here for is that
 * two runs were handed the same path, and a path is only shared once a real
 * store, a real repository and two real `git worktree add`s have said so. The
 * aux checkout was `<repoSlug>-resolve` — a constant per repository — while the
 * removal that precedes creating it is an unconditional `worktree remove
 * --force` plus `rmSync`. Two resolutions in one repository therefore destroyed
 * each other's working tree, each with a billed `claude` child editing files
 * inside it, and neither the guard on the way in (`assistRunning`, keyed on one
 * run) nor the assist budget (`maxConcurrentAssists`, which is two) said a word.
 * Nothing about it fails loudly: both children run to completion and write
 * `run_reviews` rows describing work that was overwritten.
 *
 * Its own file for `slotProbes.test.ts`'s reason: it needs a real git repository
 * inside a real mount, and `DATA_DIR` and `CLAUDE_HOME` set before anything is
 * required, which `land.test.ts` — pure functions, static imports — cannot give.
