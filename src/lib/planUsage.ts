/**
 * What the provider says this account has used, straight from the provider.
 *
 * Everything else in this app derives a percentage: our price table over local
 * transcripts, divided by a ceiling somebody typed. That was wrong by ~4x on
 * the machine this was written against — 5.0% reported against 1.3% derived —
 * and it could not have been anything else, because Anthropic publishes no
 * numeric value for a Pro/Max limit and the typed ceiling is a guess. The
 * arithmetic was never the problem; the denominator was.
 *
 * `GET /api/oauth/usage` is what Claude Code's own `/usage` screen reads and
 * what the web app's usage page shows. It answers with a percentage per window
 * and the instant each one resets, for the whole account — including the
 * surfaces that share the allowance and write nothing to this disk (the web
 * app, Desktop, Cowork). That is the number a user is comparing us against.
 *
 * Three properties of this source drive the design below.
 *
 *  1. **It is the account's, not this app's.** The credential is Claude Code's
 *     own OAuth token, read from the same tree whose transcripts we scan, so
 *     the answer describes the same account. The token is never refreshed
 *     here: refresh rotates it, and rotating a credential out from under the
 *     CLI to draw a meter is not a trade worth making. An expired token is a
 *     miss.
 *  2. **It is rate limited.** Hitting it a handful of times inside a minute
 *     earns a 429, and this app polls its dashboard every 1–2 minutes. So it
 *     is cached on Claude Code's own cadence — the CLI refreshes at most every
 *     5 minutes and treats a cached reading as usable for an hour, both read
 *     out of the shipped binary — and a failure serves the last good value
 *     rather than blanking the meter.
 *  3. **It is undocumented.** Same discipline as `account.ts`: every failure
 *     is a null, never an exception and never a zero. A window we cannot read
 *     falls back to the derived reading, which is what shipped before this.
