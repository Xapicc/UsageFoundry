 * What confines a tool call below the uid it runs as, and how a run says when

 *
 * Nothing here turns a sandbox on. This app configures none — `proposals/
 * Sandboxing/09-implementation-sketch.md` calls that Phase 2 — and this module
 * is the phase that has to ship *first*, because the failures the later ones
 * introduce arrive inside a tool call the run loop does not read. A too-narrow
 * allowlist and an agent that gave up produce the same run: cycles that spend
 * money and write nothing. `seedReport` exists for that reason on the seeding
 * path, and this is the same argument one boundary over.
 *
 * Two readers, both of which have to be honest in the same direction. The
 * detector below says a tool call failed *because of a sandbox*, and must not
 * say it about an ordinary permission error. The arrangement reader says what
 * this install is confined by, and must not report a sandbox that is not there.

 * denial — an allowlist that does not name the path a command wanted — comes
 * back out of a bubblewrap mount namespace as an ordinary `EACCES`, which is
 * bit-for-bit what a file the agent may genuinely not have produces. Matching
 * that would relabel every permission error in every run as a policy decision,
 * which is the second of the two ways this can be wrong and the more expensive
 * one: a signal that fires on everything is not a signal. What closes the gap is
 * a measurement, not a looser matcher — `docs/verification.md` carries the
 * command, and the marker table below is where its result goes.
 *
 * Declared in `apiTypes.ts` because the log renders one word per kind and this

 * case that has already happened here. `bwrap: ` alone is refused for the same
