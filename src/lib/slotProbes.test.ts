/**
 * Covers how many git subprocesses one admission spends choosing a checkout
 * slot, and only that.
 *
 * It is not a pure function and it is deliberately not a timing assertion. What
 * it pins is a *count*, because the fault it is here for has no other symptom:
 * `createRun` runs from entry to INSERT with no `await` — on purpose, since that
 * is what makes its folder claim atomic — so every subprocess it spawns is a
 * hold on the one event loop that drains every agent's stdout, feeds every SSE
 * stream and beats the server lock's heartbeat. Nothing bounded that walk.
 * Dirty checkout slots are left behind by design, they are never `taken`, and so
 * every admission re-ran `git status --porcelain` over every one of them, for
 * ever. The app stayed correct throughout; it simply stopped answering, for
 * longer the older the repository was, and the only way to see it is to count.
 *
 * Its own file because it needs three things `orchestrator.test.ts` cannot give
 * it: a real git repository inside the mount (that file's mounts are fixed at a
 * layout its collision cases depend on), a `spawnSync` wrapped module-wide,
 * which would otherwise count every other case in that file, and a cold slot
 * memo, since the whole question is what a *first* admission on a repository
 * costs. `DATA_DIR` and `CLAUDE_HOME` are set before anything is required, for
 * `config.ts`'s reason.
