/**
 * What a `docker compose restart` does to the work cycles it interrupts.
 *
 * The handler was synchronous end to end — `killAllAgents(sig)`,
 * `releaseDataDir()`, `process.exit(0)` — so not one suspended `startRun` frame
 * ever resumed and nothing after `await runIteration(...)` ran. Three things
 * went with it every time, and each already had a mechanism written for it:
 * `reconcileKilledCycle` recovered the cycle's spend and was reachable only
 * from inside that loop, `active_iteration`/`active_started_at` were cleared in
 * the same place, and the run's own account of why it ended was left for the
 * next boot to guess at. On twenty-five runs that is twenty-five cycles of real
 * billed tokens missing from `spent_usd_est` — invisible afterwards to
 * `RunProgress.spentGuardUSD`, to `maxRunCostUSD` and to the instance budget,
 * so a run picked up later can overshoot its own cost limit by a whole cycle.
 *
 * What this pins is that the shutdown path **awaits** the accounting, which no
 * test of `reconcileKilledCycle` itself could say: the function was always
 * correct and always unreachable. So it drives a real run to `running` against
 * a stubbed child, calls the real `shutdownRuns`, and reads the row.
 *
 * Its own file with the environment set before anything is required, for the
 * reason every database-backed test here needs it: `config.ts` fixes `DATA_DIR`
 * and `CLAUDE_HOME` at module load.
