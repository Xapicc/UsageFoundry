/**
 * What context control has been worth, as a tile for the top of the dashboard
 * beside the window meters.
 *
 * ## Why the title is "context control" and not "pruning"
 *
 * Two mechanisms sit under it. The **intake filter** rewrites a request on its
 * way to the API, replacing a tool result with a pointer past the last cache
 * breakpoint so it is never written and never re-read. The **pruner** edits the
 * transcript between work cycles so the next one resumes a shorter
 * conversation. A card titled for one of them may not carry the other's figure,
 * so the title names the subject both belong to.
 *
 * ## Why the two are added here, and what that costs
 *
 * They overlap by construction. Winnow's C1, C3 and B2 rules fire in both, and
 * the filter takes that mass first — it sees the request before Claude Code has
 * finished writing the transcript the pruner reads. The transcript still holds
 * every byte the API never saw, so a prune that removes one of those results
 * counts tokens that were never in the cached prefix and prices re-reads that
 * were never going to happen. Measured across this install's ten largest
 * transcripts that is 4.06% of pruned tokens, and it is an upper bound; the
 * correction needs a `tool_use_id` on each ledger line that winnow does not
 * write yet.
 *
 * So the sum is wrong by a bounded, measured, known-sign amount, and the choice
 * is between a figure that is a few per cent high and two figures nobody can
 * combine — which is the question this card exists to answer. It leads with the
 * sum. The split stays on the card, as a share under each span, because an
 * operator deciding whether to leave *either* mechanism on needs the halves.
 *
 * The overstatement itself is **not** printed here, and this comment used to
 * claim it was. It is recorded in `docs/verification.md` and in `contextTokens`
 * (`contextPruning.ts`); whether it belongs on the card is a copy decision
 * nobody has taken, not something that was taken and then lost.
 *
 * ## Why the week leads and the filter's share follows
 *
 * The week is the window an operator's allowance is measured in, so it is the
 * span where "what has this been worth" has an answer they can act on. The
 * five-hour window is the one they are inside right now. The all-time total is
 * last because it is history: it answers whether to leave this on, which is
 * decided once.
 *
 * The filter's share hangs off each of those rather than leading, because it
 * acts first and the pruner's figure is the residual of it — a share is what it
 * is, and it moves with how tool-heavy the week was rather than with anything
 * an operator chose.
 *
 * ## What it may not do up here
 *
 * `default` against the meters' `primary`, and the footnote, are the two things
 * keeping this away from the money it sits next to. Neither half is spend:
 * the meters are priced from `usage` frames, which report the request the
 * filter had already rewritten, so both of these are counterfactuals whose
 * value is already absent from every number beside them.
 *
 * The derivation of both stays in a band lower down. A net is three or four
 * figures netted, and an operator deciding whether to leave either on is
 * deciding on which way each went, not on their sum.

 * the filter still sends each result once, uncached, before it becomes a
 * pointer. Blending the three would hide that the mechanism pays for itself on
 * the very first request, which is the one property that makes it different
 * from a prune — and a reader has no way to check a figure whose parts are not
 * on the page.
 *
 * ## Why "results" and not "requests"
 *
 * The filter is stateless: it re-drops the same result on every later request
 * that still carries it. Counting ledger lines charges one removal once per
 * surviving request, which overstated this install by 24.8×. Each repeat is
 * already in the third row, at a tenth of the rate, which is what it is worth.
 *
 * Three qualifications sit under the table, each printed only when it is true.
 * They are the difference between a total that is incomplete and one that is
 * wrong, which is the same reason `PruneSavingsRows` prints its own.
