/**
 * The strip at the top of the content pane: what you are looking at, and the
 * one place this pane can send you next.
 *
 * Its height is a *floor*, not a height. In an installed window with Window
 * Controls Overlay the browser hands the page the whole title bar and states
 * where its own buttons are in `env(titlebar-area-*)`; the strip keeps clear
 * of them on both sides, because they are on the left on macOS and on the
 * right everywhere else. In an ordinary tab every one of those values falls
 * back to a figure that makes each `max()` pick the plain padding, so nothing
 * here branches on which case it is in — which matters, because the tab is
 * the only case that could be checked from this container.
 *
 * The empty part of the strip drags the window; every control on it says
 * `app-no-drag`, because a drag region swallows the pointer press.
