 * The app's destinations, once.
 *
 * The source list draws them, the toolbar titles itself from them, ⌘1…⌘9
 * navigates to them and quick open searches them. Four readers is why this is
 * a module rather than an array inside the sidebar: a pane added in one of
 * them and missed in the others is a pane you can reach and cannot get back
 * from, or a shortcut that lands somewhere the list does not highlight.
 *
 * The digit follows the row's position rather than the pane's age: a shortcut
 * that names the fifth row and lands on the sixth is worse than one somebody
 * has to relearn, so inserting a pane renumbers the ones under it. **Nine is
 * the ceiling** — ⌘1…⌘9 is nine digits and the list is eleven rows — so the
 * last **two** rows have no digit at all, and *which* rows those are falls out
 * of the order rather than being chosen: today they are API account and
 * Settings, because Taskboard went in under Runs and pushed everything below it
 * down one. The loss is always taken from the bottom, which is the only rule
 * that keeps "the digit is the row's position" true; a two-key chord to buy a
 * digit back is a different decision and not one this file may make on its own.
 *
 * That used to be a warning rather than a mechanism, and it named the wrong row
 * (Knowledge, which has been the seventh since it moved above the two
 * configuration panes, and is still seventh with Dreaming under it). It is now
 * a type: `shortcut` is optional, and the two readers that put the digit into a
 * string guard it. Both were unguarded, and both failed silently rather than
 * loudly — a screen reader announcing `Meta+undefined` and a palette printing
 * `⌘undefined`, neither a type error and neither a throw.

 * apart, the toolbar's secondary copy stuttering directly above the page's own
 * accent one. Whichever surface offers an action, only one of them does. The
