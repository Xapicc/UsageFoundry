/**
 * The vault's link graph, drawn.
 *
 * This was the app's first `<canvas>`, and the questions a canvas asks — what a
 * world coordinate is on screen, what a click is over, how a backing store is
 * sized, what a wheel notch is worth — were first answered here. They are no
 * longer answered *here*: they are in `canvasView.ts`, because none of those
 * answers is about a vault and a second canvas that copied them is where two
 * surfaces start disagreeing about what a drag does. Read that module for the
 * transform, the hit test, the pixel ratio and the colour probe.
 *
 * What stays is everything that knows this is a graph of notes:
 *
 * **What a node looks like and what that means.** Its radius is its degree in
 * the *drawn* slice, damped; its colour is the first group whose query claims
 * it, or its kind; a phantom is drawn hollow because it is a link nobody has
 * written the note for yet, and an attachment is outlined because it is a file
 * that is not a note. `canvasView` is handed a `reachOf` and a margin and is
 * told none of this.
 *
 * **Every mark here has to be distinct from every other, because the panel now
 * states them all in a legend.** Two of them were not. An attachment and an
 * unclaimed note were both a plain `--fg-muted` disc, so the `attachment`
 * branch in `colourFor` returned the same value as the fallback it sat above;
 * and the open note's ring was `--tint`, which is the same hex as `--accent` in
 * light mode and `--accent` is the fill under the pointer. Both are repaired in
 * shape and in an already-probed token rather than by adding an eighth colour
 * to `globals.css` for one node kind on one surface.
 *
 * **The simulation must stop.** A settled graph that kept asking for frames is a
 * warm laptop on a page that looks finished, so the loop ends when `step`
 * returns false and only an interaction or a changed setting starts it again.
 *
 * **The pointer is the only input here that has no keyboard route, and that is
 * deliberate.** Panning and zooming a force layout is a way of *looking*; every
 * note this can open is also a row in the Notes list on this page, which is
 * reachable, ordered and searchable. A graph is the second route to that
 * content, not the only one, so it stays a pointer surface rather than growing
 * a spatial keyboard model nobody would find. What that claim rests on is the
 * list being reachable rather than the list being *above* — which it no longer
 * is, since the graph was moved ahead of it — so the `aria-label` names it by
 * name rather than by direction.
