/**
 * What this run's own turns cost, split by who produced them.
 *
 * The run page already says what the run spent twice over — `runs.spent_usd`,
 * which is what Claude Code reported for each cycle that finished, and
 * telemetry, which is its own per-request figure. Neither can answer "how much
 * of this did the main thread produce itself", because neither records which
 * agent produced a turn. The transcripts do: `attributionAgent` is on the
 * assistant record
 * already, which is why this reading is the *same* source the dashboard meters
 * come from rather than a new one, scoped to one session id.
 *
 * So it is a reading beside the other two and never a correction to either. The
 * three measure the same run by three routes and disagreeing is the expected
 * outcome; adding any pair of them counts the same work twice, which is what the
 * copy at the foot of this card has to keep saying.
 *
 * Its own poll, on its own cadence, for the reason the route documents: this
 * costs a full transcript scan, and the run page's row poll runs every three
 * seconds against an agent competing for the same CPU.
 */

/**
 * Slower than the row poll by an order of magnitude, and deliberately so.
 *
 * A turn only reaches a transcript when Claude Code flushes it, so nothing here
 * moves faster than a completed model turn anyway — polling this at the row's
 * cadence would re-walk `~/.claude` twenty times a minute to learn nothing. The
 * same argument `liveGuardIntervalSeconds` is set by.
