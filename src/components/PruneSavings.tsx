/**
 * One span's pruning figures.
 *
 * ## Why the net leads and the gross is under it
 *
 * Every other tool of this kind reports bytes removed and stops. That number is
 * not a saving and can be the opposite of one: an edit to a cached conversation
 * invalidates everything after the cut, so removing a little from a lot costs
 * more than it earns. What is worth reading is the netted figure, so it is the
 * row in the strong weight and the two halves that produce it sit above it,
 * signed, where a reader can see which way each went.
 *
 * `tokensRemoved` is kept because it answers a different question — how much
 * conversation actually went — and because a net of $0.02 over 40,000 removed
 * tokens is a legible statement about a short run, where the net alone reads as
 * nothing happening.
 *
 * ## The two things this must never imply
 *
 * It is **not spend**, and nothing here may be added to a meter. It is the value
 * of an intervention against a counterfactual: the same work without the prune.
 *
 * And a saving is only as final as the run behind it. `turnsAfter` is turns that
 * have already happened, so a live run's figure grows as it works. The caption
 * says so rather than letting a number that moves between two page loads look
 * like a bug.
