/**
 * What each repository cost, over a span.
 *
 * The figure that was missing between "this run spent $M" and "the account
 * spent $N this week": an operator watching the weekly window pass 80% across
 * fifteen repositories had no way to find out which one was consuming it, so the
 * only available response was to slow everything down.
 *
 * Three things the copy has to keep saying, because each is a way of reading
 * this wrongly:
 *
 *   - **It is a floor.** A cycle in flight has reported nothing and contributes
 *     nothing for its whole duration.
 *   - **It is not the meters.** `runs.spent_usd` is the CLI's own per-cycle
 *     figure for runs this app spawned; the windows above are our price table
 *     over every transcript on the machine. They describe overlapping work, so
 *     adding them double-counts — which is why this is a plain table rather than
 *     a meter, and why it carries no percentage of any window.
 *   - **It is not a limit.** Nothing here reaches a guard. A threshold on a
 *     repository is a limit nobody set.
 *
 * Its own request rather than a field on `/api/usage`, which is `agentSpend`'s
 * precedent: that route re-aggregates the whole transcript history every ten
 * seconds and this is one indexed read that changes when a run ends.
