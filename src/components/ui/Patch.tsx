/**
 * A block of git output, coloured by line.
 *
 * Two kinds, and they are not interchangeable. A unified diff has exactly five
 * kinds of line and a leading `+` means an addition. A conflicted file is
 * ordinary file content, where a leading `+` means whatever the file's language
 * means by it — colouring it as a diff would paint half a Markdown document
 * green. So the marker lines are what is highlighted there, and nothing else.
 *
 * Only the diff gets a gutter, and that asymmetry is the same fact: a conflict
 * region is an excerpt of a file with no header saying where it starts, so
 * numbering it from 1 would name lines that are not those lines.
 */

/**
 * Tone per row, as complete class strings — Badge's rule, and here it covers a
 * background as well as a colour. The tint is what a native diff uses to say
 * which side a line is on without the reader parsing the marker column; it is
 * deliberately faint, because a patch is mostly context and a loud one turns
 * three changed lines into a striped page.
