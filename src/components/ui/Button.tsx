/**
 * Complete class strings per variant, never interpolated — Tailwind scans
 * source as plain text, so `bg-${variant}` emits nothing and does it silently.
 *
 * Every variant states all five states, and none of them changes a box
 * dimension: rest and hover differ in colour, press differs by an *inset*
 * shadow so the button recesses without moving, focus is an outline (which is
 * outside the box model), and disabled is opacity. A press that nudged the
 * button by a pixel would reflow every sibling in a ButtonRow.
 *
 * A guard on the interaction states rather than a `disabled:hover:` undo. Both
 * were being emitted for a hovered disabled button and which one won came down
 * to Tailwind's variant sort order, which is not a contract. It is spelt
 * `not-disabled:` rather than `enabled:` so `ButtonLink` can share this map:
 * `:enabled` matches form controls and nothing else, so on an `<a>` every hover
 * and press state would emit and never match — a filled control that does not
 * answer the pointer, wrong and silent. `:not(:disabled)` is the same guard and
 * matches both elements. The focus outline colour is in here for
 * the same reason: stated once in a shared string and again per variant, the
 * two would set the same property under the same variant and the winner would
 * be Tailwind's internal order rather than anything written here. Only the
 * *colour* is here — the ring's width and offset come from @layer base, so the
 * app has one geometry and this file is not a second place to keep it in.
 *
 * `secondary` is the bezeled control macOS gives every button that is not the
 * one default action in the pane: a hairline, a raised fill, and the same
 * contact shadow a grouped box wears. It was `bg-inset`, which is the recess a
 * text field sits in — the two read as the same object at a glance, and one of
 * them is clickable.
 */
/**
 * Two of the four carry a hook for the ascii skin, and only two, because only
 * two state a label colour that was chosen to sit on a fill: `--tint-fg` is
 * whatever the OS says is legible on the accent, and `text-white` is white on
 * red. The skin takes both fills away, and either of those on a card is a
 * button nobody can read. `secondary` and `ghost` already name a text colour
 * that works unfilled, so a hook on them would be a selector with nothing
 * behind it. The rule itself is in globals.css — this file names no skin.
