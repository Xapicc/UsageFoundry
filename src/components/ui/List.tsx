/**
 * A group's heading, at the one rank a heading over a grouped box is drawn at.
 *
 * It exists as an export because a group's contents are not always rows: the
 * workflow editor's `What it does` holds two nine-line text regions, which have
 * no right edge to align a grouped row against, so they are `Field`s rather
 * than a `ListGroup` — and a run block, which has no caps, has nothing else
 * under that heading at all. Written out at that call site the heading would be
 * a second definition of this rank, and nothing would keep the two in step.
 *
 * **The two must never diverge.** A reader asks the same question of a heading
 * over rows and a heading over content that is not rows, and half a step of
 * size or weight between them reads as a hierarchy that is not there. That is
 * also why this takes no `tone` and no `size`: it is one rank, not a family of
 * them, and a variant map here would be the divergence arriving as a feature.
