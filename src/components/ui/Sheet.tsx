 * focus trap, which is the part that silently stops working the day someone
 * adds a control to the footer.
 *
 * The element is always rendered and never conditionally mounted — a closed
 * `<dialog>` is `display: none`, and mounting it in the same commit that calls
 * `showModal()` is a race. Nothing here sets `display`, for the same reason: a
 * `flex` utility would outrank the UA's `dialog:not([open]) { display: none }`
 * and leave a closed sheet lying across the page.
