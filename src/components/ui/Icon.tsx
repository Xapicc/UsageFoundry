/**
 * The app's glyphs, at one optical weight.
 *
 * There were none before this — only the brand mark in Nav, and three
 * hand-drawn theme shapes inside ThemeToggle. The two rules that make a set
 * read as a set are both enforced here rather than per call site: every glyph
 * is drawn in a 16×16 box, and the stroke attributes are set once on the <svg>
 * so nothing can arrive a half-weight heavier than its neighbour. A glyph that
 * is genuinely a filled shape (the status dot) says so locally.
 *
 * Characters were the alternative and are the thing this replaces: ◐ ☀ ☾ are at
 * the mercy of whichever font on the machine carries them, arriving at
 * different sizes, on different baselines, and on some systems in full colour.
