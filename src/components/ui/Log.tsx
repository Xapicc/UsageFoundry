 * Complete class strings per size, never interpolated — Badge's rule.

 * rather than a box that grows with its content, so the scrollbar is the log's
 * own and the page behind it does not lengthen by a screen every minute.
 *
 * Two behaviours, because it is shown two ways. Beside the inspector it *fills*
 * its column — 62vh is measured against the window, which is taller than the
 * pane and shorter than the inspector, so the column ended in a band of nothing
 * that the page nonetheless scrolled through. It fills by being taken out of
 * flow rather than by `flex-1`, which is the part worth keeping: an in-flow box
 * with no height of its own reports its *content* as its intrinsic height, and
 * a log is thousands of lines — the row would then be sized by the transcript
 * instead of by the pane. Out of flow it contributes nothing to that
 * measurement and simply takes the box it was given. The requirement on the
 * caller is the other half: at `lg` the parent must be `relative` and have a
 * height. Stacked under the inspector on a narrow window there is no column to
 * fill and the page is meant to scroll, so it stays a bounded box.
 *
 * `inline` is the older behaviour, for a log sitting among other cards.
