 * answer: a `<thead>` that kept its column widths while the `<tbody>` under it

 * `TableWrap`'s sideways scroll is the answer where a row is a set of readings
 * a reader compares; it is not a presentation of a *record*. In a 390px pane a
 * run's status and its spend are never on screen at once, and the row tint `Tr`
 * carries — the thing that holds a label and a figure on one line as the eye
 * crosses the width — does not exist on touch at all. So below `md` the grid
 * becomes one block per row and the hairline moves to the row itself.
 *
 * Opt-in because the two halves only work together: with the column heads gone,
 * a value says what it is only because its own `Td` carries a `label`, and a
 * table switched on here without them would be a column of unnamed figures —
 * worse than the scroll it replaced. So this is a prop a call site states as it
 * labels its cells, rather than a change to what `Table` does everywhere.
 *
 * The explicit ARIA roles are the other half of it. `display: block` strips a
 * table element's implicit role in every engine, taking the row and column
 * relationships with the layout; stated here they survive it. Above the
 * breakpoint each one is exactly the role the element already had, so nothing
 * about the flat table changes — including its pixels, since a role paints
 * nothing.
