/**
 * Complete class strings per tone, never interpolated. Tailwind scans source
 * as plain text, so `text-${tone}` would emit nothing at all — and would do it
 * silently, since there is no lint step in this repo to catch it.
 *
 * The tone is in the *text*, where the 4.5:1 contrast against --bg-inset is
 * met, and only hinted in the border. A full-strength ring around an 11px chip
 * put more colour on screen than the sentence it was annotating, so a row of
 * six runs read as six alarms; the `-line` tints are the same hue at 40% and
 * still tell green from red at a glance. See globals.css.
