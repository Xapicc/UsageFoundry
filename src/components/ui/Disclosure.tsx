/**
 * A fold, as the browser draws one.
 *
 * There were seven hand-rolled `<details>` in this app and they did not agree
 * on the one part of it that is invisible from any file that has it: the hit
 * target. A `<summary>` cannot buy the 44px below the breakpoint the way every
 * other control here does, because its `list-item` display is what draws the
 * disclosure triangle and a min-height on a list-item leaves the word and its
 * triangle at the top of a box the finger is aiming at the middle of. Padding
 * is the answer instead, three of the seven carried it, and a recipe kept at
 * call sites is one the eighth call site will not carry either.
 *
 * Everything else is the browser's, and that is the reason this is a native
 * `<details>` rather than a hand-rolled show/hide: keyboard operation, the
 * triangle, find-in-page expansion in the engines that have it, and correct
 * semantics with no ARIA at all. So this states **none** — a `role`, an
 * `aria-expanded` or an `aria-controls` on a native disclosure is redundant or
 * actively wrong in at least one engine, and which one is not visible from
 * here. It also states no height animation: `ui-transition` omits `height` for
 * the reason written beside it, and an animated fold is content moving under a
 * pointer that is already travelling towards it.
 */

/**
 * The whole recipe, and deliberately only the target and the states.
 *
 * The desktop box stays the caller's. The landed call sites disagree on it —
 * `py-2` on the runs list, nothing on the branches and chat folds — because it
 * is each page's own vertical rhythm, so a figure stated here would move all
 * of them to fix none of them; `ui/Patch`'s file row states `--control-h` for
 * the pointer where it sits. `hover:text-ink` is a colour rather than a fill
 * precisely so a caller can add a background hover without the two
 * declarations setting one property and the winner being Tailwind's sort
 * order. There is no press state and no disabled state: the press *is* the
 * fold opening, which says more than a tint, and a `<summary>` cannot be
 * disabled.
