/**
 * The surface a workflow is drawn on.
 *
 * It owns the gestures and nothing else: where a block sits, what links what and
 * what is selected all live in `WorkflowEditor`, and every rule about what a
 * workflow may *be* lives on the server. This file decides only how a pointer
 * and a keyboard reach the same four actions — add a block, link two, remove a
 * link, remove a block — because a canvas that needs a mouse excludes an
 * operator, and this one starts billed agents.
 *
 * Each of the four has both routes:
 *   add     — drag a block off the palette, or press Enter on it
 *   link    — drag from a block's Link handle onto another, or take the handle
 *             and then the target in two presses, by pointer or by Enter
 *   unlink  — Delete or Backspace on the link's own control or on the canvas
 *             while it is selected, or Remove in the inspector beside it
 *   remove  — Delete or Backspace on the block's name or on the canvas while it
 *             is selected, or Remove in the inspector
 *
 * Delete is the *only* destructive gesture here and there is deliberately no
 * undo: this app has no undo model, and a ⌘Z that put a block back but not the
 * links that came with it, or not the position it was dragged to, would be
 * worse than the absence — the operator would stop checking. What stands in for
 * one is that nothing on this canvas has been saved yet: the graph on the server
 * is whatever Save last sent, so leaving the editor discards a mistake whole.
 *
 * Pointer and keyboard reach those through *different* events on the same
 * controls, and `handledByPointer` is what keeps them from both firing: a
 * captured pointer sequence still dispatches a `click` at the end, so the
 * keyboard's handler would add a second block or re-arm a link that had just
 * been drawn. The `click` handler stays because it is also what a screen reader
 * or voice control dispatches, with no pointer events in front of it.
 *
 * Nothing here animates position. A dragged block follows the pointer exactly,
 * which is why it is an inline `left`/`top` with no transition on it —
 * `ui-transition` deliberately omits `transform` and `width`, and a block that
 * eased into place would lag the hand holding it.

          card is a plain div, so `activeElement` stays `<body>` and the key never
          enters this subtree. Pressing inside a focusable region focuses the
          region, so this is the one attribute that connects "click a block, press
          Delete" to the handler written for it. Out of the tab order, and a

          when the inspector holding the block's guards is under it. It could
          not answer the other one: `overflow-auto` on a sheet at least 640px
          wide is what keeps the *pane* from scrolling sideways, so a reader at
          390px pans two axes through a window onto 22% of the graph's width to
          reach the sixth block. Hiding the sheet costs the arrangement, which
