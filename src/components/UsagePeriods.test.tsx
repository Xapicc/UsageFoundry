/**
 * This card prints a percentage against a ceiling Anthropic does not publish.
 *
 * A week is measured against the weekly ceiling as it stands, and that is a
 * plain reading. A day and a month are measured against that same ceiling
 * spread over their own length, which is a *pace* — on the transcripts this was
 * written against, one real day reads 254% of a pro-rated $314. Without the
 * sentence saying where the number came from, that is a reader being told they
 * have blown through two and a half times an allowance that does not exist, and
 * the failure is silent in both directions: the sentence attached to a weekly
 * view would instead imply the weekly window is unguarded, which is the
 * opposite of true. Nothing throws, nothing fails a typecheck, and the number
 * beside it is correct either way.
 *
 * `limitBasis` is what selects the wording and it comes off the same
 * computation that produced `fraction`, so what these tests pin is that the two
 * cannot be wired apart.
