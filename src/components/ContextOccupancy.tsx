/**
 * How far the figure may fall behind the read before the gap is worth naming.

 * on any tool call and says nothing an operator needs. What this catches is the

 * one sub-agent, whose main thread has not been billed for a request in
 * minutes, and whose figure is nonetheless the current one.
 */
const HOLD_NOTICE_MS = 3 * 60_000;

/**
 * How full one run's context is now, and how it got there.
 *
 * ## The one thing this must not be read as
 *
 * Every other token figure on the run page is either money or the transcript's
 * own turns. This is neither: it is `apiContextTokens` — the whole prompt as the
 * API was billed for the last finished request — which is the basis the cycle
 * ceiling acts on and the *only* basis a percentage of that ceiling can be
 * computed in. The pruning block two regions away counts `contextTokens`, and
 * the two are tens of thousands of tokens apart **in both directions** on this
 * install: the prompt carries a system prompt and tool list no transcript holds,
 * while the intake filter drops tool results the transcript keeps. So a prune's
 * `tokensRemoved` is not the drop drawn here, and subtracting one from the other
 * produces a number that looks entirely ordinary.
 *
 * The caption used to say that on every render, on the same grounds
 * `LiveTelemetry`'s footnote did. Neither does now, and it went the same way in
 * both places: the operator read the standing paragraph as wall-of-text and
 * asked for it gone, so **nothing on this panel
 * states the separation to a sighted reader** — the sr-only prune table still
 * warns at its own figures, and this comment is the rest of the record. The
 * invariant is unchanged, only unsurfaced, and the arithmetic that breaks it
 * still typechecks: anything editing this file, or reading these two figures
 * together, has this paragraph and nothing on the screen to catch it.
 *
 * ## Why the ceiling travels on the wire
 *
 * `ceilingTokens` comes from the DTO and is never written here. The constant
 * behind it has already moved twice — 167,000, then 300,000, then 200,000 — and
 * a component dividing by a hardcoded 200,000 would go on drawing the old
 * percentage after the next move, correctly-looking and wrong.
 *
 * ## Why the age shown is not the newest point's
 *
 * `lastCheck` is when the tick last *read* this run; the newest sample is when
 * the number last *moved*. They come apart by design — the series is
 * deduplicated on the `usage` frame it came from, and a run whose main thread is
 * inside one sub-agent gains no frame at all for as long as that lasts, measured
 * at 22 minutes on this install. Drawing the sample's own timestamp as "read 22m
 * ago" said the poll had died when what had actually happened was that the
 * figure was still correct, which is the one thing this panel must not get
 * backwards. So the age is the read's, and the hold is said separately.
 *
 * ## What the picture claims
 *
 * Every returned sample is drawn; nothing is thinned. The series is already
 * capped server-side at `CONTEXT_SERIES_MAX_POINTS` as a **tail** rather than a
 * thinned set, and when it is holding one the caption says so — a graph that
 * quietly drops points claims a smoothness its data does not have. Dots are the
 * one thing that stands down on a long run, and they carry no information the
 * line does not, except for the fallback-basis markers, which are drawn at every
 * length because a reading in a different measure is not decoration.

/**
 * What the window is made of, over the same span as the series above it.
 *
 * ## The one thing this must not be read as
 *
 * It is drawn against **winnow's** window, not the sample series'. Both are the
 * same measure — `input + cache_creation + cache_read` on a priced request —
 * and they are anchored differently: `apiContextTokens` takes the last
 * *main-thread* frame, sidechains excluded, because a sub-agent's turns are not
 * this conversation's context; winnow takes the last priced request in the
 * transcript whatever wrote it, and a sub-agent's frames are in that same file.
 * So the two agree on an idle conversation and come apart for exactly as long
 * as a sub-agent runs — 22 minutes at a stretch on this install. Scaling these
 * bands onto the sample's figure would hide that; the caption names it instead,
 * and nothing subtracts one from the other.
 *
 * ## Why the cycle ceiling is not on this chart
 *
 * It is on the one above, where the figure it bounds is drawn. Repeating it
 * here would put this app's own policy line across a picture measured from a
 * different anchor, and the first thing anyone would do with the two is read
 * the gap between them.
 *
 * ## Why the axis is the taller of the two, and what the hatch is
 *
 * The bands sum to the window by construction, the residual among them — and
 * the residual is negative wherever the provenances over-explain the window,
 * which winnow puts at a third of sessions and which was every reading of the
 * run that surfaced this once it carried tool traffic. A negative band has no
 * height, so the positive ones stand taller than the window, and an axis sized
 * to the window alone — which is what this was — clamped every running total
 * at its top: from the reading where tool traffic and retained reasoning alone
 * crossed it, standing configuration, prefix and conversation were drawn with
 * their top on their bottom, present in the legend and absent from the picture.
 * That read as tool traffic pushing the prefix out of the window, and the
 * prefix is the one part of the window nothing can move. So the axis is the
 * taller of the window and the bands at every reading, and the excess — from
 * the window up to what the bands claim — is drawn as a hatched strip over
 * whichever bands it falls in, in the residual's own fill: it is those bands'
 * claim past the window and not a seventh provenance, and `hatched` is already
 * this app's word for a span nothing can put a figure on. The legend's residual
 * row wears the same stripes and a signed figure, and one caption says what the
 * strip is and why it exists, since neither is visible.
 *
 * ## Why the bands are ordered by total and not by size at each reading
 *
 * Winnow returns its nodes largest-first *per reading*, so two readings can
 * disagree about the order — and bands that swap places mid-chart cross each
 * other, which reads as one provenance turning into another. The order is
 * settled once, over the whole series, and every reading is stacked in it.
 *
 * ## What picking a band opens, and what that is not
 *
 * The one piece of client state on this panel. A picked provenance draws its
 * subtree under the legend — the *newest* reading's, which is the only one that
 * carries a tree — and picking it again closes it. It is not a `Disclosure` and
 * not a set of them: one region below the chart whose subject changes is a
 * selection, where six panels each opening under their own row and closing each
 * other is the accordion `docs/agent/conventions.md` forbids. So the legend rows
 * are `aria-pressed` toggles rather than `aria-expanded` headers.
 *
 * ## Why the stack dates itself
 *
 * The pane has one age line and it is not this reading's: "read 40s ago" is
 * `lastCheck`, the guard tick, which paces the figure and the sparkline. This
 * reading is paced by distance instead — 40,000 tokens of movement, or a cut —
 * so the two coincide only by accident and this one is routinely many minutes
 * older. Six current-looking figures under someone else's timestamp is a dated
 * reading rendered as an undated one, and the age used to be reachable only
 * inside `CompositionDetail`, behind a click no reader makes on first sight.
 * "Shape taken" rather than "read": the verb is what tells the two apart.

 * pick. What is left is a reading that exists and holds nothing below this band,
