/**
 * A shape per run status, at the leading edge of a row the way a native list
 * puts its state marker.
 *
 * The word is the accessible fallback and is always somewhere on the same row;
 * this is what makes nine rows separable at a glance without reading any of
 * them. Tone alone cannot do that job — `paused`, `stopped`, `blocked` and
 * `needs-review` are all amber, so in greyscale or to a colour-blind operator
 * the badge carries no signal until it is read word by word.
 *
 * One copy. The runs list and the run card each drew their own set, and the two
 * had drifted: one paused run wore two rounded bars and the other two square
 * ones, and a third caller was about to make it three.

 * only alive, `=` for the pause bars, `!` for the bang that asks the reader for
 * something — because the shapes were chosen to be separable at a glance and
 * that is the property the port has to keep. Nine distinct characters, checked
 * against each other and not only against the SVG each replaces: `+` and `x`
 * are the two endings and read as opposites, `#` is the stop square, and
 * `blocked`'s `/` is the slash through the circle it is drawn as.
