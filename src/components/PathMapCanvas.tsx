/**
 * A `PathPlan`, drawn — the arrangement, and none of what a node means.
 *
 * The app's second `<canvas>`, and it answers none of the questions a canvas
 * asks: the transform, the cull rectangle, the framing, the nearest-within-reach
 * hit test, the pixel-ratio sizing and its observer, the wheel's `deltaMode` and
 * the colour probe all come from `canvasView.ts`, and the layout from
 * `forceLayout.ts`. What is here is everything that knows this is a *repository*
 * — and nothing that knows which repository fact is being drawn.
 *
 * That last split is the reason this is a component and not a copy: what a file
 * node's fill says, what rings it carries and which colour tokens those need are
 * a map's own vocabulary, so they arrive as `radiusOf`, `paintFile`, `tokens`
 * and `ariaLabel` rather than being decided here. A second map that pasted this
 * file to change four of those would also inherit every fold-transition bug
 * fixed below, silently, one copy at a time.
 *
 * **The edges are containment and never causation.** A line means "is in", so
 * the only thing a line asserts is a path. That is the whole reason the node set
 * is files: an attribute promoted to a node is a star, a dozen hubs with nearly
 * everything hanging off one of them, and it draws one fact. What a file *is*
 * rides on the node — its fill — and the rest is a line in an inspector.
 *
 * **A directory anchor is not a hub.** It is where its files hang and a label,
 * drawn as a small hollow ring so it reads as a place; nothing about a count, an
 * actor or an attribute is encoded on it.
 *
 * **The simulation must stop.** A settled layout still asking for frames is a
 * warm laptop on a page that looks finished, so the loop ends when `step`
 * returns false and only a gesture or a new plan starts it again.
 *
 * **Pointer-only, deliberately, and for `KnowledgeGraphCanvas`'s reason.** Every
 * file a map like this draws is also a row in a table that is ordered,
 * searchable and reachable; this is the second route to that content, not the
 * only one, so it stays a way of *looking* rather than growing a spatial
 * keyboard model nobody would find.
 */

/**
 * Fixed rather than offered as sliders, unlike the knowledge graph's.
 *
 * That surface's sliders exist because a vault's shape is the thing under
 * investigation and no single setting reads every vault. Here the shape is the
 * repository's, it is the same shape every time, and a control that changes it
 * would only make two operators' screenshots of one run disagree. The numbers
 * are the graph panel's defaults with a shorter spring: a directory's files sit
 * around it as a rosette rather than at arm's length.
