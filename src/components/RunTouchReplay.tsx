/**
 * A playhead over the order a run named files in, driving the map beside it.
 *
 * **The step is one tool call, never one file.** A file read forty times is
 * forty steps and its node accumulates forty touches — which is the whole of
 * what an operator comes here to see, and the reason the figure above the map
 * prints the call count beside the distinct-file count rather than leaving the
 * handle position to imply which of the two the track is measuring.
 *
 * **Nothing here says a call succeeded.** A mark advancing file to file reads as
 * progress, so the hedge `RunTouchNotes.tsx` states once for both surfaces
 * governs this one too: a recorded call is an *attempt*, and this replays what
 * the run tried in the order it tried it.
 *
 * **Position 0 is rest and the map is untouched there.** The replay is a mode
 * over the existing view: at 0 nothing is dimmed, nothing is marked, and the
 * canvas draws exactly what it drew before this control existed. Reset is the
 * one press back to it from anywhere.

/**
 * Wall-clock seconds a whole replay aims at, and the rates that bound it.

 * A fixed steps-per-second is wrong at both ends — a 40-call run finishes before
 * an eye has found the first node, and a 6,000-call one runs for a minute and a
 * half at any rate slow enough to read. So the rate is the sequence's own length
 * over a target duration, clamped: the floor keeps a short run watchable and the
 * ceiling keeps a long one from being a flicker. A sequence past the ceiling
 * runs longer than the target, deliberately — the alternative is skipping steps,
 * and a replay that skips is a replay that draws a run that did not happen.
