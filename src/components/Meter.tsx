 *

 * subject: the figure the guard acts on, where the solid fill is what was
 * measured. It is drawn as a hatched band extending past the solid fill,
 * because that span is precisely the part we cannot put a number on. Without
 * it the budget guard would refuse a run at a threshold the visible meter has
 * not reached, with nothing on screen to explain why.
 *
 * *What* widens it differs by call site — an unpriced model charged a fallback
 * rate on a window meter, a work cycle that stopped before reporting on a spend
 * one — so the sentence a screen reader hears comes from the caller as
 * `upperHint`. It used to be one guess made here, and that guess was false at
