/**
 * The sentences two surfaces have to say identically about the same data.
 *
 * The table under the diff and the map at `/runs/[id]/touched` read the same
 * `run_events` rows through the same reconciliation, so a hedge worded twice is
 * a hedge that drifts — and the one that matters here is not a caveat but the
 * whole of what a recorded call means. `run_events` stores a tool *call* when it
 * is made and a *result* only when it failed (`orchestrator.ts`), and the
 * failure row carries no `tool_use` id joining it back, only a
 * whitespace-flattened 160-character command string that is wrong exactly inside
 * a retry loop. Nothing either surface draws may say a touch succeeded, and the
 * sentence saying so lives here once.
 *
 * The three ways of having nothing are here for the same reason: swept, named-no
 * file and no-such-run all render as an empty list on one surface and as an
 * empty canvas on the other, and both read as a run that touched nothing.
 *
 * `Fact` is here on the same argument one step down: the map's inspector and the
 * replay's readout name the same four things about the same call — the path, the
 * tool, and `touchActor`'s `main`/`delegated`/sub-agent answer under the label
 * **By** — and two label rows written out separately are two vocabularies that
 * drift into disagreeing about one row.

 *
 * `touches` is the third figure and it is optional because only one surface has
 * it: the table under the diff reads the collapsed scan and has no call count to
 * print, and the map fetches the ordered sequence and does. Where it is given it
 * goes in **this** sentence rather than beside the scrubber it measures, because
 * a run that read 39 files in 412 calls has two numbers that are both about the
 * same rows and read as a contradiction any further apart than one clause.
