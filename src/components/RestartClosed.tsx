/**
 * "N runs were closed out by a restart", and one press to pick them all up.
 *
 * The only route back used to be the run page, one run at a time, each asking
 * for a budget at the door — and nothing in the product said the runs were
 * there at all. The count went to a `console.warn` at boot, into a container
 * log, so the operator's first sign of a restart was a dashboard that had gone
 * quiet.
 *
 * Read once rather than polled. It is a fact about the last boot: it changes
 * when this component changes it, and at no other time.
 *
 * The press is behind a `Sheet` because it starts up to N billed agents at
 * once, which is the one thing in this app that never happens without somebody
 * saying so a second time. The sheet states the count, which is the number that
 * matters.
