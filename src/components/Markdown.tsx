/**
 * Markdown, rendered without a markdown dependency.
 *
 * It began as the three headings a review is asked for — a shape this app
 * specified — grew into how each work cycle's final message is rendered and how
 * the orchestrator's own turns are, and now also carries the knowledge page.
 * Those two inputs are not the same thing and the difference is what shapes
 * everything below. A cycle's report is markdown nobody asked for: a model
 * writes it, and it carries fenced code, inline paths in backticks, numbered
 * steps and the occasional issue URL. A note is markdown somebody *chose*, in
 * Obsidian, using the whole of what Obsidian draws — callouts, tables, task
 * lists, footnotes, tags, `==highlights==`, `[[wikilinks]]`. Text this renderer
 * does not understand falls through as prose, which on a report is a marker
 * left visible and on a vault is the page failing at its one job: a note whose
 * callouts, tables and checkboxes all render as literal punctuation reads as a
 * file that was never rendered at all.
 *
 * So this covers Obsidian's *markdown*, and deliberately not its *rendering
 * plugins*. Four things are left undone rather than guessed at, and each is a
 * dependency or a route rather than a parser: `$…$` and `$$…$$` need a TeX
 * layout engine; a ```mermaid fence needs a diagram renderer (it renders as the
 * code it is, which is honest); `![[note]]` transclusion needs a second fetch
 * and a recursion guard; and a vault-relative image needs a file-serving route
 * with the containment `resolveInMount` does for a folder — so an `![](…)` is
 * drawn only where the URL is one a browser can already fetch, and is its alt
 * text otherwise. Raw HTML stays refused; see below.
 *
 * A dependency was considered and not added. This is string handling that emits
 * React nodes, so there is no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and no sanitiser to
 * keep current — which matters precisely because the input is model-written and
 * unreviewed, and because a vault is written into by the very agents this app
 * spawns. Importing a parser to turn that into raw markup would be the one
 * change here that could make it dangerous rather than merely plain. The link
 * support below is where that stops being theoretical, which is why `safeHref`
 * is a scheme allowlist and an unknown scheme renders as its own literal text.
 *
 * Local imports are relative and never `@/`: `tsconfig.test.json` emits plain
 * CommonJS and nothing rewrites the alias at runtime, so a tested component may
 * only import relatively. The three it takes are kit primitives that import
 * nothing but React themselves, and each is here because the alternative is
 * writing out a recipe that already exists — `Disclosure` is what a `<details>`
 * in this app is, and `Table`'s `stack` plus a `label` per cell is the whole of
 * what keeps a table readable below the breakpoint.

 * h3 so that a note opening at `##`, which is most of them, does not skip a
 * level under the title above it.
 *
 * Four sizes because a note is an outline somebody wrote and six levels drawn
 * at two near-body classes is a flat wall. Rank and size are allowed to
 * disagree: the rank is the note's place in *this page*, the size is the
 * author's own hierarchy, and only one of the two has to be clamped. `#` and
 * `##` differ by weight, everything below them by size — 15 / 13 / 12 on the
 * app's scale — because hierarchy here is said with size, weight and
 * whitespace, never with a colour or a second border.
 *
 * The top margin carries the rest. A heading has to group with what is under
 * it, and the gap *below* one is not the heading's to set: adjacent margins
 * collapse, so a following paragraph's own `mt-2.5` wins whatever `mb` is
 * written here. The space above is therefore what says "new section" — 28 / 24
 * / 20 / 20 against the 10 a paragraph or a list contributes below and the 12 a
