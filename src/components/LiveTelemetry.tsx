/**
 * What runs have spent inside the dashboard's 5-hour window, as Claude Code
 * itself reported it: the window's own total, and the run-by-run derivation of
 * it. One card, in the row of meters at the top of the page.
 *
 * It exists because a run in flight has nothing else to show. Per-cycle spend
 * lands on `runs.spent_usd` only when the CLI emits its terminal `result`
 * event, so a cycle that is still going reads $0 for its whole duration — and
 * on the dashboard, where the meters cover every session on the machine, the
 * most expensive thing happening right now was invisible as a *cause*. It is at
 * the top for the same reason: it is the only figure on this page that moves
 * *during* a work cycle, and in a band of its own it was around 5,700px down.
 *
 * It is a third reading, never a correction to the meters. The meters price
 * every transcript on this machine with our own table, this counts one class of
 * session with Anthropic's, and the work overlaps — so a reader who adds the
 * two gets a number that means nothing. Beside the meters rather than four
 * thousand pixels below them, that addition is one glance away.
 *
 * The card no longer argues that at length. It carried a footnote stating the
 * prohibition and the operator deleted it (2026-09-04): a card in this row is a
 * title and a figure, and three lines of grey prose under one is what the
 * provenance regions further down the page are for. What is left of the claim
 * is two words of the title, so `— first-party` is load-bearing copy rather
 * than a flourish and is pinned in `LiveTelemetry.test.tsx` in its own right.
 * The summing hazard is not reduced by the deletion — the same trade, made the
 * same way and for the same reason, is on record in `ContextOccupancy.tsx`.
 *
 * The per-run table is on this card and not a second one, which is the other
 * half of that edit: two cards under the same heading, one of them a strict
 * subset of the other, are read as two measurements. The cell is narrow — 533px
 * at 1920px, `minmax(0,1fr)` from `xl` and the whole row between `lg` and `xl`
 * — so the table keeps the `ListView`/`stack` pair it had in the wide band
 * rather than dropping columns: sideways scroll above `md`, one block per run
 * below it, and no column of the breakdown lost at any width.
 *
 * `default` against the window card's `primary`, for `ContextControlAside`'s
 * reason: elevation is what says this sits beside the money rather than inside
 * it, and there is at most one `primary` on a screen.
