/**
 * The Tokens column is a sum this card does itself, and the sum is the whole
 * risk.
 *
 * `TokenCountsDTO` has six members and a window's volume is all six. Dropping
 * one — `cacheWriteUnattributed` is the one that arrived last and is easiest to
 * forget, and it is 100% of the write volume on a transcript written before the
 * TTL split shipped — understates every row against the meter this table exists
 * to break down, and
 * it fails nothing: the column still holds a plausible number, the typecheck is
 * green, and no total on the page is drawn across these rows to disagree with.
 *
 * The tail is pinned for the reason `docs/agent/git-and-review.md` gives about a
 * shortened diff: a list that stops at fifteen saying nothing reads as the whole
 * set, and the count is drawn from the same constant that does the slicing, so
 * the two cannot be wired apart.
