 * now"; this answers "what has this been costing me", which is a question the
 * 5-hour block table could only be read sideways to answer. Nothing here feeds
 * a guard — see `buildPeriods`.
 *
 * The load-bearing copy is the ceiling sentence. Anthropic enforces a 5-hour
 * window and a weekly one and nothing in between, so a day's and a month's
 * percentage are measured against the weekly ceiling spread evenly over that
 * span. That is a rate the operator's own configured number implies, not a
 * published allowance, and a reader who takes "82% of today" for an allowance
 * they are about to exhaust has been told something false. `limitBasis` comes
 * off the same computation that produced the fraction, so the sentence cannot
 * drift from the arithmetic.
