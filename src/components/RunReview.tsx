/**
 * An AI read of what the run changed — asked for, never automatic.
 *
 * The button is the whole point: a review is a billed Claude Code invocation,
 * and one that ran on its own would be spend nobody authorised. Its cost is
 * shown here and nowhere else — it is deliberately absent from the run's own
 * spend, which counts work cycles.
 *
 * The renderer this used to own now lives in `Markdown.tsx`, because a work
 * cycle's own final message is rendered with it too. It gained fenced code and
 * inline markers there — a review that quotes a patch is better for it.
