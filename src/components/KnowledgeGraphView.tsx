/**
 * The graph region: the canvas, the panel that drives it, and the one fetch
 * both are built from.
 *
 * **One fetch, every kind, no server-side query.** `/api/knowledge/graph`
 * accepts `kinds`, `tag` and `q`, and none of them is used here beyond asking
 * for all four kinds at once. Every control in the panel then narrows what was
 * fetched, in `knowledgeGraph.ts`, in the browser. That is the difference
 * between a toggle that answers in a frame and one that answers in a round
 * trip over a vault walk — and the whole panel is built to be *swept* through,
 * because what it is for is finding the setting that makes a shape appear.
 *
 * **The panel's search is not the page's.** The Notes list has its own folder /
 * tag / type / text filters, and the graph deliberately does not read them: the
 * graph's query is the one Obsidian's graph view has, over the whole vault, and
 * a graph silently showing the twenty notes the list happened to be filtered to
 * would be a second view of the vault that disagrees with the first about what
 * is in it. They narrow the same vault from two places on purpose. That list is
 * now directly *below* this region rather than three screens above it, which
 * makes the independence easier to notice and also easier to mistake for a bug
 * — so the `Filters` footnote says it in a clause rather than leaving a reader
 * to type in one box and wonder why the other did not move.
 *
 * **Settings live in the browser, not in `Settings`.** This is presentation
 * state for one operator at one screen size — the same class of thing as the
 * sidebar's docked width, the theme and the workflow editor's saved layout,
 * all three of which are already `localStorage`. Putting it on the server would
 * make one person's force sliders everybody's.
 *
 * **The panel leads with what the canvas is saying, not with what changes it.**
 * A legend, a readout of the node under the pointer, and `Fit` sit above the
 * view scope. None of the three narrows anything; all three are about the
 * picture, and the top of this column is the part of it nearest the picture at
 * both widths — beside the canvas above `lg`, directly under it below. Two of
 * them exist because the canvas could not be *read*: nothing said what a colour
 * or a size meant, and the only way to ask what a node was, was to click it,
 * which navigates. Neither is folded, deliberately: hiding an explanation is
 * the move the folds further down are paid for, not a move to make twice.
 *
 * **`fitNonce` and `pointed` are events, not settings**, so neither is in
 * `KnowledgeGraphSettings` and neither reaches `localStorage` — a stored fit
 * would reframe the graph on a later visit for a press made last week.
 *
 * **Three groups fold and the rest never do.** `Display` and `Forces` are tuned
 * once and left, and the colour-group *editor* is 48 of the panel's controls at
 * a first visit — which is most of what "overwhelming" was about. What does not
 * fold is what a sweep touches or a reader needs: the view scope, the four
 * `Around this note` controls, all five filters, the legend, the readout, `Fit`,
 * and `Reset to defaults`, which sits at the level of everything above it and
 * so may not be demoted below any of it. The three are independent siblings and
 * nothing is nested, which is the sanctioned shape rather than an accordion.

          4:3 is the box's *floor*, not its size, and that is what the sizer
          below is for. A ratio is what a viewport is for a graph — the height
          follows the width the pane actually has, where a figure like `32rem`
          was a portrait window on a phone and a letterbox on a wide one, and
          the shape of the box decides how much of a force layout is on screen
          at a given zoom. It is deliberately not a `vh`: a box inside the pane
          is never sized in viewport units, because the pane is the window less
          the toolbar less its own padding. But the panel beside it is taller
          than 4:3 of the canvas column at every width that fits the two side by
          side, so a fixed ratio left a few hundred pixels of empty card under
          the graph and the row's height was decided by a column of sliders.

          Both children sit in the same single grid cell: the sizer, which is
          `self-start` so it contributes its ratio to the row and never takes
          the row's height back, and the graph, which stretches to whatever the
          row ends up being. `align-content` on a grid is `stretch`, so a lone
          auto row grows to fill the card — and the card is itself a stretched
          item of the outer grid, so what it fills is the taller of the two
          columns. Stacked below `lg` there is no second column and the ratio is
          all there is, which is where it belongs. */}
