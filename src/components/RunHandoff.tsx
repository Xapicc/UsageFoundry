/**
 * The generation of the Land tab that `RunLand` replaced, kept whole and moved
 * one click away.
 *
 * Two things it says are not said anywhere else — the commit list as the agent
 * wrote it, and the `git merge` line — so it is an escape hatch rather than a
 * duplicate, and Tier 2 evidence is what a fold is for.
 *
 * What it withholds is unchanged and must stay withheld: the merge command is
 * absent entirely while the operator's checkout is dirty, never shown with a
 * warning, because a copyable command gets copied.
 *
 * Takes the event rather than its payload, and renders nothing without one: a
 * run that never handed off has no fold, and the alternative is a `&&` at the
 * call site that this component's own absent case already states.
