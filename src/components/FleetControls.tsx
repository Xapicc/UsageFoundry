/**
 * The three controls that act on the whole install.
 *
 * Every stop in this app is per run or per workflow instance, which at
 * twenty-five unattended runs is twenty-five pages — so the only install-wide
 * control was stopping the container, and that discards every in-flight cycle's
 * spend accounting. These three compose out of the transitions a single run
 * already uses; see `src/lib/fleet.ts` for why none of them is a new one.
 *
 * Both consequential presses go through a `Sheet`, and the stop's opens with
 * Cancel focused — that is what `danger` does, and one Return on a control that
 * ends twenty-five billed agents is not a confirmation.
 *
 * The hold is deliberately **not** part of the stop. An operator stopping the
 * fleet to re-point it wants the queue to carry on afterwards; one who wants
 * both presses both, and the sheet says so in a sentence.
