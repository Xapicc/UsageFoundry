/**
 * Five failure modes, all silent, all of which render a picture that looks
 * entirely ordinary:
 *
 *  - A percentage computed against a hardcoded 200,000. `CYCLE_CONTEXT_CEILING_TOKENS`
 *    has already moved twice, which is why it travels on the DTO at all; a
 *    component that divided by a literal would go on drawing the old number
 *    after the next move, with nothing to say it had.
 *  - A run with no readings drawn as a 0% fill. "Nothing measured" and "measured
 *    at nothing" are opposite statements and the same empty bar.
 *  - A fall in the line with no mark under it. That is what an operator reads as
 *    a bug in the graph rather than as the prune mechanism working, which is the
 *    single most useful thing this picture says.
 *  - The caption rendering as an empty paragraph. Its standing prose was removed
 *    — the operator read it as wall-of-text — so every clause left in it is
 *    conditional, and a `<p>` with no children still takes its bottom margin
 *    under the chart. Its currency sentence went with the prose, and with it the
 *    assertion that used to pin that sentence: the hazard it named is unchanged
 *    and now lives only in `ContextOccupancy.tsx`'s module doc and in the
 *    sr-only prune table's warning at its own figures.
 *  - The age drawn against the newest *point* rather than the newest *read*.
 *    Samples are deduplicated on the `usage` frame they came from, so a run
 *    inside one sub-agent gains none for as long as that lasts — 22 minutes,
 *    measured on this install — and the panel then reported a poll that had
 *    died over a figure that was current. Both halves are pinned: the age comes
 *    off `lastCheck`, and the hold is named rather than left to be inferred
 *    from an age that no longer moves.
 *
 * `LiveTelemetry.test.tsx` is the precedent for the last one: a component whose
 * copy is load-bearing gets that copy pinned.
