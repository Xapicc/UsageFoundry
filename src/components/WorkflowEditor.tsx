/**
 * The canvas a workflow is drawn on, and the inspector its selection is edited
 * in.
 *
 * **The graph is the whole interaction and nothing stands in for it.** Blocks
 * with nothing in front of them start at once, and several of them is the
 * parallel case — there is no separate thing to model and nothing to call it in
 * the copy. A link carries the two answers the wire needs, and the picker starts
 * on neither: `on-success` terminates a chain the operator meant to run
 * regardless and `on-finish` starts a run on top of a dependency that crashed,
 * so a pre-selected condition is wrong half the time in both directions.
 *
 * **Nothing here decides what a workflow may be.** A cycle, a template that has
 * been deleted, a workspace that is not mounted, a folder that cannot be
 * resolved, a block with no task, a loop block whose guards give it no checkout
 * of its own to carry between passes: every one of those is
 * `normalizeWorkflowInput`'s answer, asked over `/api/workflows/validate` while
 * the graph is being drawn and shown in its own words. A second copy of those
 * rules here would be a second set to keep in step, and the day one of them
 * changed the canvas would be confidently wrong about what Save would do.
 *
 * A block names a template for its guards, or names none and takes the guard set
 * in Settings. There is deliberately no permission-mode, per-block budget or
 * isolation control: those decide what an agent may do, and a workflow decides
 * what work to do. The one exception is the workflow-wide budget, which bounds
 * something no per-block guard can see — ten blocks under a $5 block limit is a
 * $50 workflow.
 *
 * The agent picker is not a second exception, and its placement says so: it
 * sits with the work rather than in the guards group, because a saved agent
 * holds no tool list and no permission mode — it decides who the block's child
 * *is* and never what it may do. That is a larger claim than it was while the
 * flag was `--agents`, and it survives the move for the same reason it was made:
 * `--agent` sets a system prompt and a fallback model, and every guard on the
 * block is argued somewhere else. It is the block's own and never its
 * template's, for the reason the workspace picker is; `WorkflowNode.agentId`
 * has it in full. Beside it is the sentence the run form also carries: the
 * registry is a *part* of the set of agents in play and never the whole of it,
 * because the mounted `~/.claude` reaches every child this app spawns.
 *
 * The inspector is a sticky column beside the canvas rather than a form under
 * it, which is what a canvas app on this platform does — but the reason it
 * matters here is that the operator is reading the graph and the block's guards
 * at the same time. `BlockStatement` is that pairing made explicit: every block
 * says in one sentence which guard set applies, where it runs, how many runs it
 * may start and whether it may pay to reconcile a conflict. That sentence is
 * what a press of Run is approved against, so it is prose rather than a row of
 * controls to be read off.

/**
 * Positions live in this browser, keyed by workflow id, and never in the graph.
 *
 * The alternative — an `x`/`y` on `WorkflowNode` — makes dragging a block a
 * change to the object `topologicalOrder` reads and `normalizeWorkflowInput`
 * rebuilds, so a cosmetic gesture would bump `updated_at` and land in the same
 * blob as what runs. It also would not survive the trip: the normalizer builds
 * each node from a fixed list of fields, so the coordinates would be dropped in
 * passing and the drag would silently not persist.
 *
 * What that costs is stated rather than absorbed: an arrangement someone made
 * by hand does not follow them to another browser. What does follow is the
 * *layout*, because `autoLayout` derives one from the edges — so a graph saved
 * before this existed opens readable, with no migration in front of it and
 * therefore nothing that could lose an edge on the way in.
