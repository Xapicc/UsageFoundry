/**
 * The container's Codex login, beside the Claude one and deliberately not
 * folded into it.
 *
 * Two credentials, two providers, two rows — the same argument that keeps
 * "Sign-in" separate from "Claude account" one line up. What makes this row a
 * different *shape* rather than a copy is that a Codex device sign-in is
 * finished somewhere this app cannot see: the CLI prints a link and a one-time
 * code, then polls OpenAI on its own, and the operator approves it in a browser.
 * **That approval is the manual step and nothing here can take it.** So there is
 * no code field to paste back into — the field next door — and instead a poll,
 * because the only way this page learns the sign-in worked is by asking again.
 *
 * The poll stands down the moment `pending` is null, which is the general rule
 * for one here: with no device login in flight nothing about this row moves
 * without a button being pressed. It re-arms off the reload that follows a
 * press, not off a flag, so a flow started in another tab is picked up too.
 *
 * The Sign in button is offered only when signed out, and that is a safety
 * property rather than tidiness: starting a device flow **deletes the stored
 * credential immediately**, before anybody has approved anything, so a press
 * beside a healthy login is a sign-out that might not be followed by a sign-in.

          trailing edge with Discard to its left, which is where a Mac window
          puts them. Sticky, because one Save commits every field on a page five
          sections long and the button must not be somewhere you have to hunt
          for after editing something at the top.

          The negative margin must match the shell's gutter at each breakpoint,
          or the bar is wider than the page and scrolls it sideways.

          Opaque and raised, not translucent: this bar spends most of its life
          lying across the middle of a card, and `bg-canvas/95` + blur left the
          card's border and text showing faintly through it — in dark mode,
          where canvas and surface are four hex digits apart, it read as a card
          torn in half with a button floating in the gap rather than as a bar in
          front of one. The upward shadow is what says "in front".

          Both buttons are always rendered, and the status line always occupies
          a line: a bar that gains a button the moment a field changes moves the
          only control the operator is reaching for. */}

          px-4: a sticky bar is never pushed *past* where it sits in flow, so
          that bottom padding stayed underneath it as a band of nothing between
          the bar and the foot of the window. */}
