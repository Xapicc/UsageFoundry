/**
 * Every refusal the new-run form can make, pinned one at a time.
 *
 * The bar this clears is `budgetPayload.test.ts`'s, from the other direction.
 * That one asserts what a limit sends; this one asserts that the form still
 * objects before it sends anything. Both failures are silent: a refusal that
 * stops firing does not throw, does not fail a typecheck and leaves a page that
 * looks right — it just starts the unattended agent the refusal existed to hold
 * back, under a guard the operator was never told was missing.
 *
 * Written as a characterisation of the block that lived inline in `page.tsx`
 * before it was moved here, so these are the record of what the form refused
 * then, not a description of what it ought to refuse.
