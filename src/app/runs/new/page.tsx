                the operator's own and a new model is a settings edit rather
                than a release. Blank still means inherit, so the fallback rungs
                are untouched.

                Free text for a Codex run, because the catalogue is seeded from
                a table of Anthropic prices and holds Claude Code's own id
                spellings — offering them for a run that will not spawn Claude
                Code would be a picker that is confidently wrong, and the door
