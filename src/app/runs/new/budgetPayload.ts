/**
 * What the Model field means on the wire: a `model` key, or no key at all.
 *
 * Beside the budget rather than inside it, and that is the whole reason it is a
 * separate function: a model moves cost and bounds nothing, so a `BudgetPolicy`
 * that grew one would be claiming a guard where there is none — the same line
 * the form draws by putting the field beside the agent instead of among the
 * limits.
 *
 * An object to spread rather than a `string | null`, because *absent* is what a
 * blank field has to send. `createRun` resolves a run's model as
 * `input.model ?? settings.defaultModel`, so the fallback belongs to the run
 * that named none — and the form shows today's default as the input's
 * placeholder rather than pre-filling it, because a pre-filled value would be
 * posted, frozen onto `runs.model`, and would then survive every later change
 * to the setting it was copied from.
 *
 * Trimmed, and otherwise sent verbatim. An alias, a full id, or a name this
 * build has never heard of are all valid — narrowing to a list would refuse the
 * model that ships next week — but whitespace is not a value: `--model "  "` is
 * a spawn the CLI refuses, where a blank field is a run that starts.
