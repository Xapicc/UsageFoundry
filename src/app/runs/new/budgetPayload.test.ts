/**
 * What `POST /api/runs` and `POST /api/templates` are handed, pinned field by
 * field.
 *
 * The bar this clears is the repo's own: silent and expensive. Every limit here
 * has an off state, `null` is what expresses it, and a number left in a box the
 * operator switched off is a valid `BudgetPolicy` — so sending it starts an
 * unattended agent under a cap nobody set, with nothing on the page, in the
 * types or in the log saying so. The window pair fails the other way: the field
 * shows 0–100 and the wire wants 0–1, and `normalizePolicy`'s `frac()` reads a
 * bare 1 as 100%, so a factor-of-a-hundred slip is a guard that never fires.
 *
 * These assertions are the record of what the form sent before it was
 * restructured onto `LimitField`, not a description of what it sends now.
 *
 * The model is pinned here too, and fails a third way: the key's *absence* is
 * what reaches `createRun`'s `input.model ?? settings.defaultModel`, so a form
 * that sends the placeholder it shows — or a `model` key holding the spaces
 * somebody typed — starts a run on a model nobody chose, with nothing on the
 * page or in the types saying which one it was.
