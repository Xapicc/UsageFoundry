              one place the difference matters, and it was measured rather than
              argued.

              Auto table layout hands a `width` back to whichever column asked
              for `width: 100%` — the Run column, which is what makes it the one
              that gives — so none of these figures is what the browser draws:
              Status renders 84px against the 150 written here, Cycles 59
              against 88, Spent 56 against 92. A `min-width` *would* be honoured,
              and on a wrapped table that is the right answer. Not here. This
              list is the app's one table outside `TableWrap` (`box="plain"`
              above), because an `overflow-x-auto` would pin the sticky header
              to a box that never scrolls — so a floor under these columns is a
              floor under the *pane*. Measured: with floors the table stops
              shrinking at 594px and the pane scrolls sideways from ~615px down,
              which covers every window from 768px (where the table is still
              flat) to about 880. With plain widths it keeps collapsing to
              468px and the pane never scrolls at all.

              conventions.md ranks those two costs and this is the losing side
              of it: "a table must not be the reason the pane scrolls
              sideways". What it buys is that a long status wraps — "next up —
              starts when the folder frees" comes out one word per line at
              84px. That is a real cost, recorded rather than fixed, and the
              fix is to shorten the status line or give the pane a wrapper, not
              to change these back. */}

          The two are about the same restart and answer different questions, so
          they have different lifetimes: that one is *what happened*, bounded to
          the 24 hours this page calls recent and gone afterwards whatever state
          the runs are in, while this one is *what is still outstanding* — it is
          driven by `runs.restart_closed`, so it stays until the last of them has
          been picked up and renders nothing at all once none is left. Above the
          tables rather than in them, because what it is about is a set of rows
          spread across both, and the operator's question is "did a restart just
          eat my afternoon", not "which run is this". */}
