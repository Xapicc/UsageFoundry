                  "its costs were never reported" is an answer to that. The
                  Costs region is where the figure is missing; this is where it
                  says why.

                  Drawn off `run.provider` rather than off a zero spend so it
                  is never confused with a run that genuinely cost nothing, and
                  never shown for `null`, which is a row that predates the
                  column rather than a row that was asked. */}

                  <strong>This run reports no cost.</strong> Codex sends token
                  counts and no money, so nothing was added to this run&rsquo;s
                  spend and nothing reached the usage windows. Its dollar
                  figures are unknown rather than zero, and its token count is
                  measured. Two other guarantees are weaker here than on a
                  Claude run: the denial that stops an agent killing the server
                  supervising it is a rules file rather than a flag, so it is
                  install-wide and does not cover a command written with
                  substitution or a wildcard; and the notices about what this
                  agent is running inside rode the prompt rather than a system
                  prompt.
