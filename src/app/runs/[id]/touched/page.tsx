/**
 * Where a run's touches are, laid out by directory.

 * A sub-route rather than a sixth tab or a tenth pane: `ui-density-audit.md`
 * freezes the run page's tab strip at five and bans both, and names a sub-route
 * as what replaces them for something that is a screen's worth and read rarely.
 * `activePane` matches on a path *segment*, so `/runs/<id>/touched` keeps Runs
 * highlighted in the sidebar without any of the four readers of `panes.ts`
 * learning about it.
 *
 * The one link in is on the "What it touched" card under the diff, beside the
 * table this draws — and it is the only one, because a destination reachable
 * from three places is three places to keep in step.
 *
 * Both answers are fetched once and neither is polled. The touch scan is an
 * index range over the busiest table in the database and its answer for a
 * settled run cannot change; the diff costs several git processes. This page is
 * a thing an operator opens on purpose, looks at, and leaves.

 * this. What goes wrong at eight hundred file nodes is not the frame rate, it is
 * that no cluster is distinguishable from the one beside it, which is the same
