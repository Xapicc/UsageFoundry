/**
 * Where a pending merge's conflicts are, laid out by directory.
 *
 * A sub-route rather than a sixth tab or a tenth pane, for the reason
 * `/runs/[id]/touched` is one: `ui-density-audit.md` freezes the run page's tab
 * strip at five, bans both a sixth segment and a tenth pane, and names a
 * sub-route as what replaces them for something that is a screen's worth and
 * read rarely. `activePane` matches on a path *segment*, so this keeps Runs
 * highlighted in the sidebar without any of the four readers of `panes.ts`
 * learning about it.
 *
 * The one link in is on the land card's conflict section, beside the list of
 * markers — and it is the only one, because a destination reachable from three
 * places is three places to keep in step.
 *
 * **This page draws and never acts.** It reads the same `GET /api/runs/<id>/land`
 * the card polls and offers no Land, no Resolve, no Delete: the card is where
 * the decisions live and where every refusal is written, and a second surface
 * carrying the same button is a second place for the chain rules to be wrong. It
 * is also fetched exactly once and not polled — the card polls only while a
 * resolution is running, and this is a thing an operator opens on purpose, looks
 * at, and leaves.
 *
 * **It is legible at n=1 and does not pretend otherwise.** Most conflicts are a
 * handful of files, where a map of four dots is worse than the list; the count
 * and the inspector carry that case. There is deliberately no guard that hides
 * the page when the picture would be thin — a surface that sometimes refuses to
 * draw is worse than one that draws four honest dots.
 */

 * Drawn file nodes before directories start folding.
 *
 * The touch map's figure, and a legibility budget rather than a performance one
 * for the same reason. A conflict this large is not something this app has
 * measured — `MAX_CONTENT_FILES` means the preview stops opening files at ten,
 * not that it stops listing them — so the budget is inherited rather than
 * guessed at downward.
