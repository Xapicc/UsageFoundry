/**
 * Every branch the tool has produced, in one place — and the queue that lands
 * them.
 *
 * A branch is created per *run*, not per checkout slot, so a few dozen runs
 * leave a few dozen `uf/*` refs behind — and until this page the only record of
 * which ones mattered was a run detail page you had to open one at a time.
 *
 * The inventory is not polled: each row costs a git process to work out and
 * nothing in it changes on its own. The queue *does* change on its own, so it is
 * polled, and the inventory is re-read once when it stops — which is exactly
 * when every state in it may have moved.
 *
 * The queue is polled **whatever it last said**, slowly while it is idle and
 * every few seconds while it is working. Gating the interval on "something in
 * the last answer was active" made an idle queue an absorbing state: with no
 * interval running nothing fetched a newer answer, so nothing could ever say
 * the queue had started again, and the only thing that could restart it was a
 * press of Land in *this* tab. A merge block in a workflow queues branches
 * directly, and so does a second tab — both of those advanced, failed and
 * landed with this page frozen on whatever it happened to be showing, which is
 * the shape of "the statuses never update even when the merge succeeds". The
 * same freeze followed a single failed read on load, since the mount effect
 * runs once. The idle tick is what makes the answer eventually true rather than
 * eventually stale; it is one `GROUP BY` and no git.
 */

 * A shape per state, drawn rather than coloured.
 *
 * Four of these seven are amber or grey, so tone alone leaves them identical in
 * greyscale and to a colour-blind operator. The word is the real signal and the
 * shape is what makes a column of them scannable; neither is the colour.

                          a run that did nothing.

                          That distinction is the whole reason the line is here,
                          so it is in the words rather than in a `title` a
                          finger cannot reach. The three words added are the
                          hover's own — it read "changed paths in the run's own
                          checkout, not on the branch" — and not a fourth name
                          for the state: the storage table above says "holding
                          uncommitted work" and `RunLand` says "uncommitted
                          paths", and both are about the same checkout this is.
                          C10 cut three wordings to two and this must not make
                          it three again, so anything reworded here is reworded
                          in all of them. The unread state is a fourth *state*
                          and not a fourth wording: it borrows "could not be
                          read" off the storage table above. */}
