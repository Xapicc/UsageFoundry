          context-control tile keeping its fixed 16rem. Which template applies,
          and from which breakpoint, is `topRowColumns` above.

          The window card used to be `minmax(0,1fr)` against that 16rem alone —
          about 84% of a 1920px row — and the comment here defended the
          asymmetry, the objection being that two co-equal cards side by side
          would say neither leads. That objection stands and so does the answer
          to it; what changed is which property carries it. `primary` against
          `default`, and a hero meter against a `text-xl` figure, are what say
          this card leads. Width was never doing that work: at 84% the extra
          space went to a `max-w-[68ch]` paragraph in a 1400px box, while the
          first-party spend figure — the one number on this page that moves
          *during* a work cycle — sat 5,700px below the fold. Half a row is
          still the widest box on the page and still the only one an elevation
          up, so nothing about what leads has changed, and neither aside's
          conclusion is now reachable only from the bottom of the page.

          Capped at half only where something is in fact beside it. A template
          with a track no card was rendered for packs the cards left and leaves
          the rest of the row blank, and a cap with nothing in the space it
          freed does the same thing on purpose — both read as something that
          failed to load, which is what `items-start` is here to avoid one axis
          over.

          `items-start` so the asides keep their own height; stretching them
          would pad a three-line card out to the meters' and make the empty
          space look like something failed to load. Below `lg` it is one column
          and they follow the meters, which is the same reading order. */}

              Removing conversation does not simply make a run cheaper: an edit
              invalidates the cached prefix, so the saving is what later turns did
              not have to re-read, less what the edit itself cost. A prune between
              two work cycles was believed to pay nothing, because the next cycle
              was going to rewrite that conversation anyway — that is the most
              likely reading and it has not been measured, so a total still
              carrying unsettled prunes is printed as a ceiling. One that ended a
              cycle early pays for the restart it caused. Both are counted here.
              A cut is left alone when the last one on that run would need more
              than 18 further turns to pay for itself.
