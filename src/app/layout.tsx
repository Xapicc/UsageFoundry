/**
 * Applies to every page under this layout, and it is the banner below that
 * needs it.
 *
 * `authEnabled()` reads an environment variable, and without this every page
 * was prerendered during `next build` — which for the shipped image means
 * inside `docker build`, where `UF_AUTH_TOKEN` is not set and cannot be. So the
 * answer baked into the HTML was "authentication is off" on every install,
 * including the ones that had set a token, and no restart could change it.
 *
 * The mirror image is the reason this is a correctness fix rather than a
 * cosmetic one: a build whose shell happened to export `UF_AUTH_TOKEN`, run
 * against a deployment without one, prerenders the banner *away* and leaves
 * every route open with nothing on the page saying so.
 *
 * The cost is small here and would not have been the same trade at the top of a
 * content site: these pages are client components that fetch their own data, so
 * what the prerender was saving is a shell, not a render.

            has to be on the element before first paint, or the page paints in
            the OS theme and then snaps. Someone on the default "system"
            setting can never flash, because that state *is* the absence of
            this attribute. Kept as raw text rather than next/script so it
            cannot be deferred.

            The collapsed sidebar rides along for the same reason and is a
            louder version of the same failure: the rail is 168px narrower than
            the list, so a state read after hydration would shove the whole
            content pane sideways one frame into every page load. The ascii
            skin is the loudest of the three — it swaps the font family and
            takes every radius to 0, so reading it after hydration reflows
            every box on the page rather than recolouring it. All three are the
            absence of an attribute in their default state, so none of them
            costs anything for someone who has never touched the control.

            One script rather than three: a second inline block would be a
            second place for the storage keys to drift from the components that
            write them, and the order the three attributes land in does not
            matter because each one is read by its own selectors. */}
