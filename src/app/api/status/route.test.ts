/**
 * The one route in this app whose reader is not a person.
 *
 * Two things about it can be wrong in a way nothing else notices. The counts
 * can disagree with the rows — a monitor thresholding queue depth then never
 * fires, which is bit-for-bit what a queue that never backs up looks like. And
 * the payload can grow a field it must not carry: this is polled by whatever
 * the operator runs, retained there and forwarded, so a folder path or a prompt
 * on it leaks what this install works on into a system with a different
 * lifetime and a different audience. Neither throws and both typecheck.
 *
 * The read-only credential is the third: `middleware.ts` exempts this path only
 * while `UF_STATUS_TOKEN` is set, so if the check here ever stops matching that
 * condition the exemption is an open route. The two are asserted together for
 * `/api/mcp`'s reason.
 *
 * It opens a throwaway database and names `CLAUDE_HOME` as well, because the
 * report walks the transcript tree for a byte count and must not be pointed at
 * the operator's own.
