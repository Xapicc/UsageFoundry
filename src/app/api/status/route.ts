/**
 * What the fleet is doing, for something that is not a person.
 *
 * **Its own credential, and that is the point.** Every other stateful route
 * here sits behind `UF_AUTH_TOKEN`, which is the token that can also start
 * billed agents — so wiring a monitor to poll one of them means handing a
 * scraper the master key. `UF_STATUS_TOKEN` is a second, read-only credential
 * that reaches this route and nothing else.
 *
 * `middleware.ts` exempts this path **only while that variable is set**, and
 * this check is the other half of that exemption — the arrangement `/api/mcp`
 * already uses, and it must stay together for the same reason. With no
 * `UF_STATUS_TOKEN` configured there is no exemption and this route sits behind
 * the ordinary gate like everything else, so the failure of an operator who
 * never set one is "my monitor gets a 401", not "my status is public".
 *
 * The comparison is constant-time and against a single configured value, for
 * `middleware.ts`'s reason: a `!==` on a secret leaks its prefix through
 * timing.
