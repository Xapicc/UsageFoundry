 * batch went on merging into the operator's checkout with nothing on the page
 * naming it, and `DELETE` takes a `batchId` the page could no longer supply.
 *
 * `working` is still the worker's own flag rather than one scoped to this
 * answer, and that is now honest: the row it can be working on is `landing` or
 * `resolving`, which is a row `queueView` covers by definition.
 *
 * `?history=1` adds the finished batches the panel is not showing. It is a
 * parameter rather than a route because it is the same resource read one screen
 * further back, and it is opt-in because this is the one read on this page that
 * polls: the card asks for it when somebody opens the disclosure and on no tick
 * where that disclosure is shut. `historyCount` rides on every answer either
 * way — it is what the closed disclosure is labelled with, and it costs the
 * `GROUP BY` this route was already paying for.
 *
 * Answered through `jsonNoStore` for the reason that helper exists: this is a
 * polled route, `dynamic = "force-dynamic"` governs Next's *own* cache and puts
 * nothing on the wire, and a queue answer held anywhere between the browser and
 * the app is a panel whose merge statuses never move while the rows behind it
 * land. `cache: "no-store"` on the page's own `fetch` speaks only to the
 * browser's cache.
