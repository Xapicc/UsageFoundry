 * One run's row, and nothing that belongs to its log.
 *
 * The run page polls this every three seconds for as long as the tab is open,
 * and what it reads is the row: status, spend, guards, telemetry. The log
 * arrives over `/api/runs/[id]/stream`, which is the one place that bounds a
 * history — it replays under both a row cap and a byte budget and says what it
 * dropped.
 *
 * This route used to ship up to 500 events beside the row under a comment
 * warning that doing so would be pure waste, and nothing read them: the page's
 * own response type names `run`, `telemetry` and `error`, and `setEvents` is
 * fed solely by the EventSource. Measured on the live container before they
 * went — 582,469 bytes of a 591,574-byte response, repeated 20 times a minute
 * per open tab.
