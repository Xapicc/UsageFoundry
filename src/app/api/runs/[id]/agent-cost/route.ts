/**
 * What this run's turns cost, split by who produced them.
 *
 * A route of its own rather than a field on `/api/runs/[id]`, which the run page
 * polls every three seconds while a run is working. This answer needs a full
 * transcript scan and a linear pass over every entry on the machine, and the
 * agent it is describing is competing for the same CPU — the same reason the
 * dashboard's own poll only speeds up to 5s and never further. The card polls
 * this on its own, slower, cadence.
 *
 * The reading is the **transcript** source scoped to one session, which is what
 * `reconcileKilledCycle` already reads for `spent_usd_est` and not a new source.
 * It is display only: it never reaches `runs.spent_usd`, never reaches
 * `buildSnapshot`, never reaches a budget verdict, and is never added to what
 * the CLI reported or to what telemetry reported.
