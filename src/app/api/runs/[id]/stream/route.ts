 *
 * **Never `jsonMaybeGzipped`, and never any encoding at all.** This is the one

 * minutes or hours, and gzip is a stream cipher over a sliding window that
 * emits nothing until it has something to emit. Compressing this would hold
 * each `log` line in a deflate buffer until the next one pushed it out — a
 * live log that runs one event behind, and a run that goes quiet showing its
 * last line only when the run ends. The replay would land in one lump and the
 * tail would stall. The frames are also small enough individually that the
 * floor in `http.ts` would decline every one of them anyway; this comment is
 * here because the *right* answer is not "the floor catches it", it is that
 * buffering a stream to compress it is the wrong shape.
