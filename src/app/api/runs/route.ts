 *
 * `total` is beside the rows for the reason `branchInventory` carries one: it is
 * counted over every matching row, so the page can say what it is a slice of. A
 * list that stops counting cannot say a run has fallen out of reach.
 *
 * An unknown `status` is refused rather than dropped, which is the opposite of
 * what `/api/knowledge/notes` does with an unknown `sort` — and the difference
 * is what the parameter decides. A sort it does not know is presentation with no
 * correctness behind it, so falling back beats failing to load. A status it does

 * Read `dependsOn` off the wire.

 * silent both times. Defaulting to `on-success` terminates a chain the operator
 * meant to run regardless of the outcome; defaulting to `on-finish` starts a
 * run on top of a dependency that crashed. So a dependency states its condition
 * or the request is refused, the same treatment `permissionMode` and
 * `enforcement` get above and for the same reason.
 *
 * `continueBranch` is the one field here that *is* defaulted, and to false.
 * Unlike the condition, it has a reading that was true of every dependency
 * before it existed, and the two mistakes are not symmetric: unset, a second
 * agent starts from the target branch and its first `git log` says so; set
 * wrongly, a run commits onto a branch nobody put it on. So absence is the safe
 * answer rather than an ambiguous one.
 *
 * Everything else about the list — unknown ids, a dependency that has already
 * failed, a self-reference, a loop, two dependencies both handing over a
 * branch — is refused by `createRun`, which is the single admission door and is
 * reached from the chat's approval path too. Its messages arrive here as the
