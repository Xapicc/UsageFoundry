 * Run tonight's pass now, with a person present.
 *
 * `origin: "form"` rather than `"schedule"`, and that is the whole difference
 * between this and the timer: the column exists to record which gate a run came
 * through, and a press is not a clock. The refusals are the same ones either
 * way — `dreamingRefusal` is asked inside `runDreamingNight` — so a press
 * cannot spend where a night would have been refused.
 *
 * The night's own cursor is deliberately **not** advanced by a press. A person
 * pressing this at noon has not consumed the night; if they press it and it
 * writes, the signatures are claimed and the 03:04 pass finds nothing left to
 * write, which is the same outcome by a better route.
