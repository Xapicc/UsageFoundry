/**
 * The recurrence readout, the ledger, and what a night would do right now.
 *
 * One route rather than three, because the page shows them together and they
 * are read once on mount — this pane deliberately does not poll. Its subject
 * moves once a night, and a 120-second poll against a table that changes at
 * 03:04 is 720 requests for an answer that cannot have changed.
 *
 * 200 even when nothing is configured. "No vault" and "the mount is gone" are
 * both things this endpoint is *for* saying, and the readout half needs neither
 * — it reads the transcript corpus, writes nothing, and is always available.
 * The payload carries `refusal` as a full sentence so the page can render the
 * reason rather than an error.
