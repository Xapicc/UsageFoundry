 * Propose limit ceilings from observed history.
 *
 * Anthropic publishes no numeric value for a Pro/Max limit and exposes no
 * endpoint to read one, so a ceiling has to come from somewhere. The least-bad
 * source is the user's own peak usage: if a 5-hour block reached N without
 * being cut off, the real ceiling is at least N.
 *
 * Both a cost and a token figure are returned, but **cost is the headline**.
 * A Claude Code workload is overwhelmingly cache reads billed at 0.1x, so raw
 * token peaks vary with context size far more than with work performed; the
 * cost peak is the steadier signal.
 *
 * Either way these are **lower bounds on the true limit**, which makes any
 * percentage computed against them conservative — it reads high rather than
 * low, so a budget guard trips early rather than late.
