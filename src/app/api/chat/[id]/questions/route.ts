/**
 * Answer what the chat asked.
 *
 * The message route with two extra facts, and it is deliberately the same
 * shape: an answer *is* a message — it goes into the thread, it starts a turn
 * against the same resumed session, and it passes the same spend gates. What
 * this door adds is which rows the message settles and a text that quotes each
 * question above its answer, so the model reads what it asked rather than a
 * bare string. Everything that bounds a turn is in `sendChatMessage`, which
 * this reaches through `answerChatQuestions` rather than around.
 *
 * Returns as soon as the child is on its way, exactly as the message route
 * does: a turn takes minutes and the row is the handle the page polls. The
 * refusals that come back with a 400 are the ones a person can act on — a turn
 * already in flight, a window past the ceiling they set, or a question the
 * conversation has already moved past, which is what a stale card sends.
 *
 * The whole call is refused when any id is no longer open rather than the id
 * being dropped, which is where this diverges from the proposals route. There
 * the ids are independent; here they compose one message, so a dropped one is
 * the operator's typed answer silently missing from the text the model reads.
