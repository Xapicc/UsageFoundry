/**
 * The approval gate.
 *
 * This is the only route in the app that turns something a model wrote into
 * processes with write access to folders, so it is deliberately narrow: it
 * takes an explicit list of proposal ids belonging to *this* chat, and an
 * action of exactly `approve` or `reject`. There is no "approve everything from
 * now on" and no setting that would create one — the authorisation is the
 * click, and it covers the batch in front of the operator and nothing else.
 * Same reasoning `merge_queue.auto_resolve` follows in recording per row what
 * was authorised per batch.
 *
 * Approvals run in one synchronous pass with no `await` between them, because
 * `createRun`'s folder claim is only atomic within an event-loop turn — two
 * proposals for the same folder must not both decide it is free. That property
 * is load-bearing twice over now that a proposal can name another one: a
 * dependency has to point at a run that exists, and every run it can point at
 * is created in this same pass. `approveRunBatch` is where the order comes
 * from, which is why the run proposals go through it as a batch rather than one
 * at a time — the page sends what it displayed, and what it displayed is
 * creation order, not dependency order.
 *
 * A workflow proposal is the other kind and settles differently: approving one
 * **saves a workflow** and starts nothing. It is still an approval — the
 * operator is agreeing to a graph a model wrote — and the second gate, the one
 * that turns it into agents, is the press of Run on the workflow page.
 *
 * A schedule proposal is the third, and the one whose approval *does* lead to
 * agents with nobody present: it puts a workflow a person saved on a
 * recurrence, through the same `putSchedule` the schedule form uses. It claims
 * no folder and starts nothing inside this click, so like a workflow it is
 * settled after the run half and is not asked the install ceiling here: each
 * occurrence goes through `startWorkflow`, which is what a press of Run goes
 * through.
