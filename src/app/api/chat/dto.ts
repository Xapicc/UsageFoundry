 * thing the operator wrote and can go and read, and an untemplated proposal has
 * no such handle — so the card has to carry those guards itself, otherwise the
 * only place the answer exists is a settings page two clicks away, and an
 * approval gate that does not show what is being approved is a gate that gets
 * clicked through. That argument stopped one step short: `Bug fix` names the
 * rules without stating them, so the same sentence applies to the template's own
 * numbers, which is what `guardsDetail` carries behind the card's fold. Written
 * by *this* function rather than by a second one beside it, since two spellings
 * of one guard set are two things to keep in step and the day they diverge the
 * card asserts a ceiling the run does not have — which is the same reason a card
 * drawn from a frozen set and one drawn from the live set are spelled by this
 * one function: differing in *wording* would read as the guards having changed
 * when they had not.
 *
 * The promise in those figures is also why an untemplated proposal freezes its
 * set onto its own row: values on a card are a promise, and a promise
 * re-derived on every poll is one the operator can be shown and never given.
 * The live set stays as the fallback for a row carrying none, and as what a
 * *workflow* proposal's blocks are summarised against — approving one of those
 * saves a graph rather than starting anything, so the guards it names are read
 * when somebody presses Run.
 *
 * `RunGuards` rather than three arguments because that is already the name of
