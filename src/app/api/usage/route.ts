/**
 * The model the `byAgent` counterfactual is priced at.
 *
 * Named here rather than inside `windows.ts` because what makes a target right
 * is what an operator could plausibly point an agent at, which is a product
 * decision and not a metering one — the rollup takes it as an argument for the
 * same reason `agentNames` is an argument. Sonnet 5 is the one that earns it:
 * it is the next tier down from the `claude-opus-5` every recorded run here
 * used, `pricing.ts` has real rates for it, and an agent carrying
 * `"model": "sonnet"` selected with `--agent` is the whole of the mechanism —
 * no schema change, and no reading of `run_templates.model`, which is a real
 * column now but names what a *template* would start rather than what any run
 * on this figure actually ran on.
 *
 * A constant rather than a setting: nothing acts on this figure, one target is
 * enough to answer "is this worth trying", and a picker would be a control that
 * changes a number nobody is billed for.
