# Where the gaps are

**The question:** where are this app's gaps — across frontend design, backend
logic, growth limits, and features it is missing — and which of them are worth a
survey of their own?

**The state:** the **frontend axis is partially promoted**; everything else is
open. Twenty verified gaps registered, six candidates dropped for lack of
evidence and seven refuted as documented decisions or by probe. Three questions
recommended for a survey, eight things recommended as issues, five refused by
name.

**Four rows were implemented**, on branch
`uf/usagefoundry-721638d11c0b-1-41e5e190`, by two runs after this register was
written:

- **[F1](01-frontend.md#f1-run-history-stops-at-100-rows-and-cannot-be-paged-filtered-or-searched) shipped** — `/api/runs` reads `offset`, `limit`, `status`,
  `q` and `settledBefore`, and the runs page pages the whole history
  (`7405720`, `d77638d`).
- **[F2](01-frontend.md#f2-quick-open-the-apps-only-search-surface-inherits-that-cap) shipped in half** — quick open asks the route for typed
  text, so a run past the hundredth is reachable; its corpus is still panes, runs
  and workflows, so a chat, a branch, an agent, a template and a schedule are
  still unfindable (`f7617fb`).
- **[F4](01-frontend.md#f4-a-runs-log-cannot-be-searched-or-filtered) shipped** — a text box and a kind picker over the events the
  page already holds, with the truncated-replay count stated when a filter is on
  (`e250524`, `e16fd7f`).
- **[F6](01-frontend.md#f6-settings-is-nine-sections-in-a-3502-line-page-with-no-way-to-find-a-field) shipped**, and so did the `beforeunload` prompt it filed as
  an issue rather than a row (`a8f2984`, `bdbdf08`).

Three more shipped later, on `main` at `d1d3119`, from PR #214 and the fixes
that followed it — **each of them a mechanism with no interface**, which is the
whole of why none is marked whole:

- **[B2](02-backend-logic.md#b2-nothing-builds-or-tests-a-branch-before-it-is-merged-and-the-setting-that-looks-like-it-does-has-one-reader) / [M4](04-missing-features.md#m4-nothing-verifies-a-branch-before-it-is-merged) shipped in half** — `landVerifyCommand` gates both
  `landRun` and `deliverRun`: argv never a shell line, a non-zero exit refuses,
  and an unparseable command refuses too rather than reading as a pass. It runs
  in the **run's own** worktree slot (`verifyTreeVerdict`), which is the half
  that had to be corrected after the merge — the first version ran it in the
  operator's checkout, standing on the target, where it never saw the work at
  all. Two things keep this from being whole: there is **no Settings field**, so
  the gate is reachable only by `PUT /api/settings` by hand; and the row's other
  half stands untouched — `resolveVerifyTools` still has one reader and it is
  still the conflict assist, so the setting that sounds like a verify gate still
  is not one.
- **[M5](04-missing-features.md#m5-nothing-can-be-prioritised-the-queue-is-strictly-oldest-first) shipped in half** — `runs.priority`, clamped ±100, higher
  first with `created_at` breaking every tie, through `queueOrder`/`queueCompare`
  into `selectPromotable` and `queuePosition`. The row's headline — that
  `queuePosition` reports a place nothing can leave — needed a second fix to
  close: priority reached the promotion order at the merge and not the readout,
  so a run raised to the front started first while the page went on saying it
  was queued behind three others. Not whole because there is **no control** on
  any page; the only way to set one is `PUT /api/runs/:id/priority`.
- **[M1](04-missing-features.md#m1-the-app-can-push-nothing-and-open-no-pull-request) shipped, and is the least proven thing here** —
  `deliverRun` pushes the branch and opens a pull request, one endpoint, one
  press, never forced, never reached from the run loop, refusing without a
  credential for that repository. The credential also needed a fix after the
  merge: it pushed through `git()`, whose `gitEnv()` strips the whole `UF_`
  namespace, so it reached GitHub unauthenticated. **No pull request has ever
  been opened by it.** The push and the API call are covered by unit tests and
  by their refusal paths, not end to end against GitHub, and there is no button.

**[F3](01-frontend.md#f3-a-chat-turn-renders-nothing-until-it-finishes-the-run-path-streams) and [F5](01-frontend.md#f5-nothing-that-renders-is-checked-by-anything) did not ship, and neither did B1, B3, B4, B5,
G1–G4, or M2, M3 and M6.** Thirteen of the twenty rows are exactly as surveyed
and three more are half closed, which is why this directory is not renamed. The
invariants behind the frontend four moved to `docs/agent/conventions.md` and
`docs/agent/testing.md`, the operator's half to `docs/runs.md` and
`docs/install.md`, and what a person still has to open and click to
`docs/verification.md`; the landing three are in
`docs/agent/isolation-and-landing.md` and `docs/agent/run-lifecycle.md`, and
**none of the three has an operator-facing doc yet**, because none of them has a
surface for an operator to be told about.

**The recommendation below was to survey reachability first, not to implement
it.** The implementation was taken instead. Nothing about that answers Survey 1's
actual question — *what should an operator be able to find, and by what
mechanism, across chats, branches, agents, templates and schedules* — which is
still unanswered, and four point fixes to the run surface are not an answer to
it. The falsifier the recommendation named is also still unrun: nobody has
executed `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM runs` on the live install, so whether reachability
was the right axis to lead with remains unestablished, before or after the work.

## The recommendation

**Survey reachability first** — [06-recommendation.md](06-recommendation.md#survey-1-reachability-what-should-an-operator-be-able-to-find-and-how).
Eight of the twenty rows are one sentence: *the app cannot find what it has
already done.* A hundred-row runs list with no parameters, a search that indexes
two lists, thirty reachable chat threads, a log with no filter, twenty-five
nameable repositories, a settings page with no field search. They share a fix
and the repository already contains the pattern twice — `/api/branches` takes
`repo`/`offset`/`limit`, and `/api/knowledge/search` is a real parameterised
search pointed at the operator's vault rather than at their own runs.

**What would overturn it:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM runs` on the live install. If
history is a few hundred rows, reachability is theoretical and the landing
boundary leads instead. That query is one line and **this survey could not run
it** — `DATA_DIR` is unreadable by the agent uid — which makes it the cheapest
falsifier here and the largest hole in the register.

**Runner-up:** the landing boundary
([Survey 2](06-recommendation.md#survey-2-the-landing-boundary-what-must-be-true-before-an-agents-work-leaves-the-machine)) — the register's #1 row, and the
only group whose failure lands in the operator's product rather than in
UsageFoundry.

## The register at a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| Rows | **20** (21 gap ids; one carried once under two framings) |
| Frontend / backend / growth / missing features | 6 / 5 / 4 / 6 |
| Dropped for lack of evidence | 6 |
| Refuted as documented decisions, or by probe | 7 |
| Rows whose failure lands in the operator's product, not this app | **1** |
| Rows that violate a documented invariant | **0** |
| Rows resting on an explicitly assumed premise | 4 |
| Rows already owned by an open issue, squarely | 1 (#78) |
| Rows since implemented | **3 whole, 1 in half** — all frontend |

**Every other count above is as surveyed at `175ba57`, not as it stands today.**
They are what the register said when it was written, and the four implemented
rows are still counted in them — recounting them would make the file disagree
with the twenty sections it indexes. The status lines in
[01-frontend.md](01-frontend.md) and [05-register.md](05-register.md) are the
current reading.

Full table, ranked, with evidence and confidence per row:
[05-register.md](05-register.md).

## The three worth a survey

1. **Reachability** — what should an operator be able to find, and by what
   mechanism? Five genuinely different answers, two of which pull in opposite
   directions, and one of which collides with a documented invariant.
   [→](06-recommendation.md#survey-1-reachability-what-should-an-operator-be-able-to-find-and-how)
2. **The landing boundary** — what must be true before an agent's work leaves
   the machine? Nothing builds or tests a branch before `landRun` merges it
   (`src/lib/land.ts:947-1057`); the setting that sounds like it does has one
   reader and it is the conflict assist (`:1275`); the concurrency guard covers
   one exported door of five; and there is no push and no pull request anywhere
   in `src/`. **Not ExternalValidator's question** — that one is a semantic
   reading of the diff, this one is whether the code builds.
   [→](06-recommendation.md#survey-2-the-landing-boundary-what-must-be-true-before-an-agents-work-leaves-the-machine)
3. **What should check the UI** — 16,529 lines of page code, zero page tests, no
   jsdom, no browser in CI, and four narrow-viewport entries on
   `docs/verification.md`'s "Not yet verified by hand" list. A survey rather than
   "add Playwright", because the operator's own vault has already read the
   coverage literature that stops the obvious answer being taken on faith.

## The three biggest things the register says that no single row does

**Nine of twenty rows are reachability.** They would be filed as nine unrelated
tickets and fixed nine times. **Four of them then were** — three whole and one in
half, as four separate changes on one branch — and the four still open include
[G2](03-growth.md#g2-chat-threads-past-the-newest-30-cannot-be-reached-at-all), chat threads past the newest 30, which has the same
one-parameter fix as the runs list and did not get it. That is the observation
being demonstrated rather than refuted.

**The chat surface carries four rows and the run surface carries none of the
equivalents.** Incremental persistence, publish-after-persist, a mid-flight
budget check, a paged list — every one exists in this repository, built for
runs, documented in `docs/agent/`. Chat is the newest surface and inherited none
of them. That is why the recommendation for those four is *one issue*, not a
survey: the answer is already written down, one module over.

**Nothing on the register violates a documented invariant.** Every row is
something `docs/agent/` never had an opinion about, and six candidates died
because it did. The invariants hold.

## What this survey could not do

- **Read any run history.** `DATA_DIR` is not readable by the agent uid;
  `.data/usagefoundry.db` in the checkout is stale (last written 2026-08-19) and
  was used only for one schema probe. No row rests on a count of real runs.
- **Run a container.** Docker is unavailable here, so nothing was checked
  against a live fleet, the image `HEALTHCHECK`, or a reproduced collision.
- **Open a browser.** At any viewport. Which is [F5](01-frontend.md#f5-nothing-that-renders-is-checked-by-anything)'s point.

Full accounting, including every command run and its output, what was
deliberately left unread, and every dropped candidate:

Verification loop on the tree this was written against (`175ba57`):
`npm run typecheck` exit 0; `npm test` 1,578 tests / 230 suites / 0 failures;
`env -u __NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE_CONFIG npm run build` exit 0. The tree is
green, and that is the point — none of these twenty is something a green tree
tells you.

Re-run on `a34e56b`, the head of the branch carrying the four fixes:
`npm run typecheck` exit 0; `npm test` **1,660 tests / 245 suites / 0 failures**;
`env -u __NEXT_PRIVATE_STANDALONE_CONFIG npm run build` exit 0. Also still green,
and 82 more assertions — none of them about anything that renders, which is
[F5](01-frontend.md#f5-nothing-that-renders-is-checked-by-anything)'s point after roughly 900 more lines of interactive page
code. **No browser was opened and no container was started for any of that work,
at any viewport**; `docs/verification.md`'s "Not yet verified by hand" list is
where that is recorded and it is the list to work through.
