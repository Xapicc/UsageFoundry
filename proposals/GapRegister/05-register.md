# The register

**Twenty rows.** Twenty-one gap identifiers across the four axis files, with
[B2](02-backend-logic.md#b2-nothing-builds-or-tests-a-branch-before-it-is-merged-and-the-setting-that-looks-like-it-does-has-one-reader) and [M4](04-missing-features.md#m4-nothing-verifies-a-branch-before-it-is-merged) carried once as
one gap with two framings.

Every row points at a file and line, a command whose output is quoted in
[00-method.md](00-method.md), or a documented invariant it contradicts. Six
candidates were dropped for lack of evidence and seven were refuted outright;
five of the refutations are in
[00-method.md](00-method.md#refuted-or-already-decided) and two in
[03-growth.md](03-growth.md#refuted-on-this-axis).

Ranked by *cost of leaving it*, discounted by confidence. Blast radius alone
does not rank a row — [B1](02-backend-logic.md#b1-the-landing-guard-covers-landrun-and-none-of-the-other-four-doors) has the widest and sits sixth
because no failure was reproduced, and [G3](03-growth.md#g3-one-process-is-the-hard-ceiling-and-the-usual-escape-route-is-not-the-one-that-applies) has an unbounded
one and sits last because it costs nothing today.

**Seven rows have since been implemented and are marked in the table below.**
Four on the frontend axis: rows 3 ([F1](01-frontend.md#f1-run-history-stops-at-100-rows-and-cannot-be-paged-filtered-or-searched)), 15 ([F4](01-frontend.md#f4-a-runs-log-cannot-be-searched-or-filtered))
and 18 ([F6](01-frontend.md#f6-settings-is-nine-sections-in-a-3502-line-page-with-no-way-to-find-a-field)) shipped, and row 4 ([F2](01-frontend.md#f2-quick-open-the-apps-only-search-surface-inherits-that-cap)) shipped in
half — the hundred-row cap on run search is gone, the two-list corpus is not. All
four are on branch `uf/usagefoundry-721638d11c0b-1-41e5e190`; each section in
[01-frontend.md](01-frontend.md) carries the commits and what the fix actually
was.

Three more on the landing axis, from PR #214 and the corrections that followed
it, on `main` at `d1d3119`: rows 1 ([B2](02-backend-logic.md#b2-nothing-builds-or-tests-a-branch-before-it-is-merged-and-the-setting-that-looks-like-it-does-has-one-reader) / [M4](04-missing-features.md#m4-nothing-verifies-a-branch-before-it-is-merged)),
7 ([M1](04-missing-features.md#m1-the-app-can-push-nothing-and-open-no-pull-request)) and 12 ([M5](04-missing-features.md#m5-nothing-can-be-prioritised-the-queue-is-strictly-oldest-first)). **All three are
mechanisms with no interface** — a settings key with no field, a priority column
with no control, a delivery endpoint with no button — so each is marked in half
rather than whole, and row 1's second framing (`resolveVerifyTools` still has one
reader and it is still the conflict assist) is untouched. Two of the three needed
a correction after the merge that the PR's own live evidence could not have
caught: the gate ran in the operator's checkout rather than the run's, where it
never saw the work, and the delivery push carried no credential because
`gitEnv()` strips the `UF_` namespace. **M1 has still never opened a real pull
request.**

**Nothing else on the register moved**, and every figure in this file — the
row count, the axis split, the confidences, the ranking — is **as surveyed** at
`175ba57` rather than as it stands today. Read a marked row's status line before
acting on its rank.

One unmarked row is now **contradicted in its evidence** by that work and is
otherwise unchanged: row 11 ([G1](03-growth.md#g1-nine-list-routes-read-parameters-the-one-for-runs-does-not-and-the-pattern-repeats-three-times)) reads "`/api/runs` is the only
route in the tree returning a capped list and reading no `searchParams`", and
`/api/runs` now reads five of them (`src/app/api/runs/route.ts:73-93`). The row's
actual claim — that this is a pattern rather than an incident, recurring at 100 /
30 / 25 — survives with its first instance struck: the 30 in `src/lib/chat.ts:289`
and the 25 in `src/lib/workspace.ts:168, :188` are untouched, so the pattern is
now two instances and a demonstration that fixing one at a time is what the row
predicted.

## How the ranking was made

Three inputs, in this order.

**Cost of leaving it, now.** Not blast radius. A gap that is catastrophic and
has never fired ranks below one that costs something every week. This is why
row 1 beats row 6, and why row 20 is last despite being the only unbounded one.

**Confidence, as a discount rather than a filter.** A medium-confidence row
stays on the register and moves down. Two rows are explicitly marked as resting
on an assumption — [M1](04-missing-features.md#m1-the-app-can-push-nothing-and-open-no-pull-request)'s demand and
[M5](04-missing-features.md#m5-nothing-can-be-prioritised-the-queue-is-strictly-oldest-first)'s queue depth — and both are ranked as if that
assumption is even money.

**Whether something already owns it, as a tiebreak only.** An owned gap is still
a gap; it just should not become a new proposal. Four rows carry an issue
number, and only [B5](02-backend-logic.md#b5-the-chat-can-identify-only-the-first-25-repositories-always-the-same-25) is owned squarely rather than
adjacently.

## What the shape of the register says

Three observations that no individual row carries.

**Nine of twenty rows are one sentence: the app cannot find what it has already
done.** Rows 3, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16 and 18 are all reachability — a cap without
a parameter, a corpus without an index, a log without a filter, a page without
a search. Row 2 is the same failure applied to the code itself. This is the
single largest theme and it is not how any of them would be filed individually.

Three of those eight have since been closed whole (3, 15, 18) and one in half
(4), which leaves rows 2, 9, 11, 13 and 16 open plus the corpus half of row 4 —
and leaves the observation itself intact, because they *were* fixed as four
separate changes. [G2](03-growth.md#g2-chat-threads-past-the-newest-30-cannot-be-reached-at-all) — chat threads past the newest 30 — has the
same one-parameter fix as row 3 and did not get it.

**The chat surface carries four rows (8, 10, 14, and half of 9) and the run
surface carries none of the equivalent ones.** Every mechanism chat lacks —
incremental persistence, publish-after-persist, a mid-flight guard, a paged
list — exists in this repository, built for runs, documented in
`docs/agent/architecture.md` and `docs/agent/budgets-and-guards.md`. Chat is the
newest surface and it did not inherit them.

**Nothing on the register is a violation of a documented invariant.** Every one
is something `docs/agent/` never had an opinion about. That is a strong signal
about where the next hour of documentation is worth spending, and it is the
reason four candidates died as documented decisions rather than surviving as
rows.
