#   ca-certificates   — outbound TLS to the Anthropic API.

#
#   python3, make, g++ — node-gyp's toolchain. Node ships with this image but a
#                       native addon does not: `npm ci` builds from source
#                       whenever no prebuild matches, and better-sqlite3 — which
#                       this app and both projects it was built against depend
#                       on — is exactly that case. Without these an isolated run
#                       fails on its first `npm install`, which is the command a
#                       fresh worktree needs before it can run anything at all.
#                       The `deps` stage above installs the same three for the
#                       same reason; this is that gap closed on the runtime side.
#   curl              — the universal "is the server I just started answering?"
#                       and the form every README writes a smoke test in.
#   jq                — what an agent reaches for the moment a command answers in
#                       JSON, and the container had none: `gh … --json`, this
#                       app's own API and the CLI's JSONL transcripts are all
#                       read that way from memory. Absent, the failure is
#                       `jq: command not found` *inside a tool call*, which no
#                       part of the run loop reads — the cycle ends looking like
#                       the agent chose not to answer the question it was asked.
#                       It belongs in the image rather than in an agent's first
#                       Bash call for the reason the Go block below gives: apt is
#                       root's and the agents are UF_AGENT_UID, and a package
#                       installed into the writable layer is discarded by the
#                       next `up --build`. It is reachable under UF_SANDBOX for
#                       the same reason `git` is — bubblewrap binds the root
#                       filesystem read-only and the managed policy's `denyRead`
#                       names only DATA_DIR and /backups, so nothing on
#                       /usr/bin is confined away. Roughly 1 MB with libjq1 and
#                       libonig5. Debian pins 1.6, so 1.7's additions (`pick`,
#                       `abs`, `toarray`) come back as `is not defined` rather
#                       than as a feature that silently does nothing.
#   procps            — `ps`/`pkill`. Debian slim omits it, so an agent that
#                       backgrounds a dev server cannot check whether it lives.
#   less              — git's pager. Absent, `git log` still works but prints a
#                       broken-pager warning the agent then reasons about.
#
#   sqlite3           — the recovery procedures in the docs are written in it,
#                       and they were unrunnable: `docker exec … sqlite3` was
#                       `command not found`, so the only documented way out of a
#                       stuck row failed at the first word. Roughly 2 MB. The
#                       backup and restore scripts below do not need it — they
#                       go through better-sqlite3, which is guaranteed present
#                       because the app depends on it — but somebody holding a
#                       backup file at 3am wants a shell they can inspect it in.
#
#   bubblewrap, socat — the two apt halves of the CLI's own Linux sandbox, which
#                       `docker-entrypoint.sh` can be asked to switch on with
#                       UF_SANDBOX and which is off in every stock install. The
#                       CLI's dependency check treats a missing `bwrap` and a
#                       missing `socat` as *errors* rather than warnings (the
#                       binary's own words: `bubblewrap (bwrap): not installed`,
#                       `socat: not installed`), so an install that turned the
#                       switch on without these would meet the failure this
#                       image exists to avoid — one arriving inside a tool call.
#                       bwrap builds the namespace; socat bridges the egress
#                       proxy's unix sockets to the TCP ports a sandboxed
#                       command dials. Roughly 1 MB together. `bwrap` cannot
#                       start at all until the operator also supplies the
#                       seccomp profile docker-compose.yml carries commented
#                       out — `unshare` is EPERM under Docker's default
#                       profile, measured in this container. `socat` is an
#                       ordinary tool and is on the agents' PATH from now on,
#                       which beside curl, python3, g++ and a Go toolchain is
#                       a rounding error rather than a new reach.
#
# This costs roughly 250 MB, nearly all of it g++. A compiler in the runtime

# winnow, bundled rather than installed at boot.
#
# The reason this is in the image and not behind `UF_PY_TOOLS` is that it is no
# longer a third-party plugin an operator might want: with `--autocompact` gone
# it is the *only* thing bounding a work cycle's context, so an install where it
# failed to arrive is an install whose long cycles run to the model's whole
# window. `UF_PY_TOOLS` installs best-effort at boot and says so in a log line
# nobody reads; a `RUN` that fails fails the build, which is the right direction
# for something the run loop now depends on.
#
# Pinned to a commit rather than a branch on the `CLAUDE_CLI_VERSION` argument:
# the run loop parses this tool's `--json` receipt and prices it, so an
# unpinned rebuild would move that contract with no announcement. Set
# `WINNOW_REF=` (empty) to build without it — `contextPruning.ts` then reports
# the feature unavailable rather than silently pruning nothing.
#
# Its own virtualenv under /opt rather than a `uv tool install` into
# `/home/node/pytools`, and that is the whole reason it survives: that path is a
# named volume, and a volume takes its contents from the image exactly once, at
# creation. An install written there during a build is masked by whatever the
# existing volume already holds — which is precisely the "installed by hand,
# lost on rebuild" failure this is meant to end. /opt is in the image layer, so
# a rebuild is the only thing that can change it.
#
# Root-owned and 0755: every agent uid reads it, none writes it. A tool the run
# loop shells out to on every cycle boundary, sitting in a directory a sibling
# agent could rewrite, would be a way for one run to put its own code on every
# other run's transcript.
# Moved 2026-08-26 from 79dd165. That commit predates `winnow safe run`'s
# ability to dispatch this repository's own commands at all: `run_under_mode`
# handed argv to the inherited CLI, where `plan` and `fork` are not
# subcommands, so the two commands the argv gate deliberately allows mid-cycle
# were the two the dispatcher could not run. `contextPruning.ts`'s `planCut`
# and `forkTranscript` both need them, and on 79dd165 both fail as unknown
# commands — the observation table stays empty and the fork engine never fires,
# with nothing saying why.
#
# It also predates `fork --write` being classified by that gate: before
# `WINNOW_SUBCOMMANDS`, `subcommand_of` matched only inherited names, so every
# command this repository added fell through `refusal_for` as unclassified and
# therefore allowed.
#
# Moved 2026-08-28 from fb49802, which worked through the recommendation list in
# that repository's `proposals/IntakeFilter/`. Five of the thirteen items were
# defects. Only one of them can reach this copy — `inspect`'s ledger reader
# counted one removal once per surviving request and so overstated its
# correction by 8.6x on that corpus and 27.2x on a real ledger, and the figure
# it feeds clamps at zero, so a large enough overcount silently produced a
# denominator of nothing. The rest are the intake filter's, which this image
# does not run: the filter comes from the bind-mounted checkout at
# WINNOW_FILTER_PATH, not from here.
#
# What `contextPruning.ts` reads is unchanged. `parsePlan` takes
# `selection.tier`, `results.tool_calls`, `results.stripped`, `bytes.*` and
# `arithmetic.*`; the new work only adds keys beside them, and the shares that
# changed base do so only when `--filter-ledger` is passed, which this app does
# not pass. Checked against a real transcript on both the direct and the
# `safe run --` path before this pin moved.
#
# Moved 2026-09-04 from 0384486, for `winnow context` — the readout the run
# page's composition stack is drawn from, which does not exist at the old pin
# and fails there as an unknown command. That failure is `contextComposition`'s
# null, so an image built on the old ref draws no stack and says nothing, which
# is why the pin is part of the feature rather than a follow-up to it.
#
# Forty-three commits, so all four subcommands this app spawns were re-checked
# against a real 8.7 MB transcript on the `safe run --` path rather than only
# the new one: `treat -rx aggressive`'s dry run still prints the `Before` and
# `Saved` lines `parseTreatEstimate` matches, in binary units and with the token
# column still pinned at zero; `plan --tier CB --json` still carries all eight
# fields `parsePlan` reads; `fork --tier CB --json` still carries `written`,
# `new_session_id`, `out`, `cold_age`, `refusals` and `plan`. `context` is
# beside `inspect` in that tree — no write path at all — so orchestrator-safe
# mode allows it while a session is live, which is the whole reason it can be
# asked on the guard tick.
#
# Moved 2026-09-11 from 0421da5, for the intake filter's relay. It read the
# upstream response with `read(8192)`, which on a chunked body keeps reading
# until 8 KB have arrived, so a sparse stream reached the agent in 8 KB lumps
# or not at all — and Claude Code 2.1.260 aborts a response after 300 s with
# no event. A long generation behind the filter therefore died at 300 s on
# every retry: run b511c547 lost one turn that way twelve times across two
# processes. The filter runs from this copy whenever no operator checkout is
# mounted (the entrypoint's fallback postdates the 2026-08-28 note above), so
# the pin is how a stock install gets the fix.
#
# Nothing `contextPruning.ts` parses moved: beside the relay, the only src/
# change in the six commits is one number in `context`'s help text.

#
# Without it the CLI still sandboxes — the dependency check reports a missing
# seccomp applier as a *warning*, not an error: `seccomp not available - unix
# socket access not restricted`, and at wrap time `[Sandbox Linux] apply-seccomp
# binary not available - unix socket blocking disabled. Install
# @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime globally for full protection.` What that warning
# costs is the network boundary: the domain allowlist is enforced by a proxy on

# command dialling that socket directly. Absent, the allowlist is advice.

# Playwright and one Chromium, so an agent can look at the page it just built.
#
# The gap this closes is that nothing in this image could *render*. An agent
# working on a web app could read its own JSX and curl its own HTML and still
# not know that a dialog opens behind its own backdrop or that a chart drew
# nothing — there was no way to produce a picture, and a picture is a thing the
# model reads directly. `playwright screenshot <url> shot.png` is one tool call,
# and the PNG goes straight into the transcript as an image.
#
# In the image rather than installed by hand, on exactly the argument the Go and
# gh blocks above make: a shell `npm install -g` survives `docker restart` and is
# discarded by the `docker compose up --build` this project is deployed with, so
# what an agent meets after the next upgrade is `playwright: not found` inside a
# tool call — which the run loop reads as the agent deciding not to look.
#
# This is the most expensive line in the file and the number is worth writing
# down: ~640 MB Chromium, ~340 MB for the headless shell that comes with it, and
# ~250 MB of X, mesa and font packages, against a 1.9 GB image. `--only-shell`
# would drop the first of those, but the shell is reachable only through
# `--channel=chromium-headless-shell`, so every screenshot command an agent
# writes from memory would fail — a saving paid for in failed tool calls.
# Firefox and WebKit are deliberately absent: a second and third engine answers
# a rendering-*difference* question, and what is wanted here is "does it look
# right at all". Both are one `playwright install` away for a run that needs them.
#
# `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` on the npm install because the package's own
# postinstall fetches every browser in its manifest, Firefox and WebKit included;
# the explicit `install` below is what decides what this image carries. The fonts
# are not optional either — `install-deps` pulls the CJK and emoji packs, and
# without them a screenshot an agent is asked to judge is full of tofu boxes.
#
# Pinned like the CLI beside it, though for a weaker reason: nothing here parses
# Playwright's output. What the pin buys is that the browser build (`chromium-…`)
# is a function of this version, so an unpinned rebuild silently changes which
# engine every screenshot in the fleet was taken with.
#
# `/opt/playwright/browsers` rather than the default `$HOME/.cache/ms-playwright`,
# and that is not cosmetic: `/home/node` is chowned recursively further down, and
# a recursive chown over a gigabyte of browser writes a second copy of that
# gigabyte into the image. The directory belongs to `node` while everything in it
# stays root-owned — so the shipped build is one every agent reads and none can
# rewrite, and a repository pinning a different Playwright version can still put
# its own build alongside rather than meeting EACCES inside a tool call.
#
# `.links` is chowned too, and it is a separate line because it answers a
# different failure. `playwright install` is not only how a browser arrives —
# it is what an agent runs to *check* that one is there, and it rewrites its own
# link file (the path of the package claiming the build) even on a re-install
# that downloads nothing. Root-owned, that no-op dies with EACCES under the
# words "Failed to install browsers", which reads as "there is no Playwright
# here" and sends the run off to fetch a second Chromium into a path it can
# write. An `-R` is affordable here and nowhere else on this path: one 67-byte
# file per installed package, not the gigabyte the line above is avoiding.
#
# This closes the case with the sandbox off, which is how the image ships. With
# UF_SANDBOX=1 the same command still fails — bubblewrap binds everything
# outside the working directory read-only, so `playwright install` reports "Read-
# only file system" whoever owns the file, and no ownership here can change that.
# Running the browser is unaffected in both modes; only installing is refused.
#
# Chromium's own sandbox is not usable here — `unshare` is EPERM under Docker's
# default seccomp profile, the same measurement the bubblewrap note above rests
# on — but Playwright defaults `chromiumSandbox` to false, so the CLI and an
# ordinary `launch()` both work unchanged. A script that asks for it explicitly
# is the one thing that will not.

# The Codex CLI, on PATH for an agent that is asked to reach for a second
# model. Nothing in this app spawns it — `CLAUDE_BIN` is still the only child
# kind there is, and `proposals/ProviderFallback/13-recommendation.md` argues
# at length against making Codex a *provider*, which would be a second
# `buildArgs`, a second stream parser, a second refusal classifier and a
# second cost story, none of them optional and every one failing silently.
# This line changes none of that: it puts a binary on PATH and stops.
#
# In the image rather than installed by hand, on the argument the gh, Go and
# Playwright blocks above all make: an `npm install -g` typed into a shell
# survives `docker restart` and is discarded by the `docker compose up
# --build` this project is deployed with, so what the next upgrade hands an
# agent is `codex: command not found` inside a tool call — which no part of
# the run loop reads, and which ends the cycle looking like the agent decided
# not to run it.
#
# **It arrives signed out, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight to
# close.** `childEnv` and its four byte-identical siblings strip
# `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `CODEX_API_KEY` from every child this app spawns, on
# the reasoning in `docs/agent/security.md` — twenty-five unattended agents
# with `Bash`, where `env` is a read-only command `acceptEdits` approves
# without asking. `codex login` writes under `$HOME/.codex`, which is an image
# layer and not one of the five named volumes, so it also lasts only until the
# next rebuild. Making either persist is a mount plus a decision about who
# holds the key, not a line in this file.
#
# ~335 MB unpacked on amd64 and ~292 MB on arm64, from a 123 MB download: a
# 259 MB `codex`, a 69 MB `codex-code-mode-host`, and its own `rg`, `bwrap`
# and `zsh` vendored under the package's own `vendor/`, none of which reach
# PATH — the image's ripgrep and bubblewrap are untouched.
#
# Last of the install blocks so that moving this pin does not invalidate the
# Playwright layer above it, which is a 640 MB re-download. Pinned on
# Playwright's weaker argument rather than the CLI's: nothing here parses
# Codex's output, so what the pin buys is only that a rebuild cannot silently
# change the tool an agent's transcript was written against.
#
# The platform binary arrives through `optionalDependencies` gated on
# `os`/`cpu`, so an `--omit=optional` added here would install a wrapper with

# /data is the one path here whose permissions are the *image's* problem rather
# than the host's, because it is a named volume: Docker initialises a fresh
# volume from the directory sitting at its mount point and copies that
# directory's ownership and mode onto the volume root.
#
# It belongs to root and to nobody else. What is in it is the settings every
# guard reads, the budget and status on every run, the whole record of what
# happened, and the lock `serverLock.ts` uses to decide whether a second writer
# exists — so an agent that can write this directory sets
# `chatDefaultGuards.permissionMode` to `bypassPermissions`, or rewrites a
# budget, with no HTTP request and no token. That is every approval gate in this
# app bypassed at once, and the lock meant to catch a second writer edited by
# the thing it is guarding against.
#
# It was 0777 because the whole container ran as an arbitrary `${UF_UID}` and a
# fresh volume had to be writable by whatever that was. The server is root now
# (see the `USER` note below), so it needs no such grant, and the mode is what
# excludes the children — which are dropped to that same `${UF_UID}`. The
# alternatives still do not work: a chown to a build-arg uid makes the image
# uid-specific and stale the moment the uid changes. What *has* changed is that
# an entrypoint chown is possible at last, because the container is no longer
# started as an unprivileged user — which is `docker-entrypoint.sh`, and it is
# not optional: only a *fresh* volume takes the mode below, so every existing
# install would otherwise upgrade into the same open directory it had before.
#
# The other four are the bind mounts' mount points and still belong to `node`
# (uid 1000): the host's own ownership covers them the moment compose mounts
# over them, and 1000 is the default the children are dropped to.
#
# `/home/node/go` is the second named volume and carries the *opposite*
# requirement to /data's: the children are the only thing that writes it, so it
# ships owned by `node` — which is right exactly while `UF_AGENT_UID` is the
# 1000 assumed here. `docker-entrypoint.sh` corrects it when it is not, for the
# same reason it reclaims /data: the ownership a volume is created with is never
# revisited.
#
# `/home/node/.local/share/gh` is the third, on the same terms: it is where `gh`
# keeps the extensions `UF_GH_EXTENSIONS` names, the children are what run them,
# and the directory has to exist in the image so a fresh volume inherits `node`
# rather than root. `extensions/` is created with it because `gh extension list`
# is what the entrypoint asks before installing anything, and gh reports a
# missing directory the same way it reports an empty one.
#
# `/home/node/pytools` is the fourth and is the same arrangement once more: the
# tools `UF_PY_TOOLS` names, installed at boot and run by the children. All
# three subdirectories are created rather than the root alone, because uv makes
# a missing one itself and would make it as whoever the install ran as — which
# on an install that never set UF_AGENT_UID is root, leaving the agents unable
# to upgrade or remove what they run.
#
# `/var/lib/winnow` is the fifth, and the only one that is neither /data's
# arrangement nor the children's: the intake filter runs as UF_AGENT_UID and
# appends its ledger there, so the directory is root's while one file inside it
# is handed to that uid by name. It is created here, outside every path the
# `chown -R` below covers, so a fresh volume takes root's 0755 rather than the
# agents' ownership — `docker-entrypoint.sh` re-asserts both, because a volume
# an older release created keeps what it was made with.
#
# **`/app` is not on that list and must never be put back on it.** It is this
# server's own bundle — `server.js`, `.next/`, the standalone `node_modules/`
# and `scripts/` — and root is what executes it, so `node:node` there made the
# unprivileged half the *owner* of the code the privileged half runs. That is
# not a smaller version of the grants above; it is the one that cancels them.
# The line reached `/app` from the days the whole container ran as `${UF_UID}`
# and the bundle merely had to be readable, and the root/agent split landed
# without revisiting it. Two paths make that root *execution* rather than a
# theoretical grant: `docker-entrypoint.sh` re-runs
# `/app/scripts/discord-relay.mjs` as root every five seconds on any install
# with `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` set — so an agent that rewrites that file and lets
# the relay exit is root within seconds, holding the very credential that
# entrypoint's own `unset` keeps out of every child — and `restart:
# unless-stopped` re-runs `/app/server.js` as root after every `mem_limit` OOM
# kill, which is routine here rather than exceptional.
# Nothing wants the grant back: the `COPY` lines above carry no `--chown`, so
# the bundle arrives root-owned and world-*readable*, no child is spawned with a
# cwd under `/app` (`chatCwd()` is a mount or `os.tmpdir()`), and everything
# written at runtime is a volume, a bind mount or `/data`. `deployment.test.ts`
# asserts the absence, because re-adding the word is a one-token edit that
# changes nothing else anyone would notice.

# The group a chat or orchestrator-block turn runs in, and no work cycle does.
#
# It carries the per-turn MCP capability file, which is 0710/0040 owned by this
# group — the whole of what keeps one of twenty-five concurrent agents from
# reading a live capability off a sibling's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` and speaking to
# /api/mcp as the chat. `src/lib/privsep.ts` argues out why this is a gid and not
# a second uid: the chat child must stay the uid that owns the mounted
# `~/.claude`, because that credential is what it authenticates and bills with.
#
# 65533 rather than 1001, and the distance is the point: compose defaults
# `UF_CHAT_GID` to this, and the app *refuses to boot* when it equals the gid the
# agents run as, since the mode pair would then grant exactly what it refuses.
# A number just above the operator's own is one an operator plausibly has;
# 65533 is below `nogroup` and free on this base image.
#
# Only the numeric gid decides anything — the kernel never reads /etc/group for
# a permission check, and both `spawn` and `chown` here are given numbers. The
# entry exists so `ls -l` inside the container names it, and so this default has
# one place it is written down rather than two.

# No `USER node`. The server runs as root and drops every child it spawns to

# the split has to be this way round rather than the other. In one sentence: the
# child must be the uid that owns the bind mounts, because an isolated run is
# ordered to commit into the operator's own `.git`, and the server must be able
# to read `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, which the CLI keeps at 0600 owned by
# that same uid — so the two cannot both be it, and the privileged half is the
# one this app wrote rather than the unattended agents reading repository
# content nobody here reviewed.
#
# Nothing about the image assumes it: with `UF_AGENT_UID` unset the app runs
# exactly as it did before, one uid for everything, and says so in its boot log.

# Liveness. `restart: unless-stopped` in compose sees process *exits* and
# nothing else, so a server whose event loop is wedged, whose SQLite has become
# unwritable, or which has lost its data-directory lock runs indefinitely with
# Docker reporting it as fine. This is the only other signal Docker has.
#
# Pointed at /api/health rather than at `/`: with UF_AUTH_TOKEN set — which any
# server deployment requires — `/` is a 307 to /login, which `curl -f` treats as
# success, so the naive probe passes against a server that cannot open its
# database. /api/health performs a real read and takes SQLite's write lock, and
# answers 503 when that fails; the route's own comment says what it does and
# does not detect.
#
# The numbers, and why:
#
#   --timeout=10s      the wedged-event-loop case. Nothing in the body can
#                      report a loop that is blocked outright, because the
#                      handler never runs — the probe simply never answers, and
#                      this is what turns that silence into a failure. Ten
#                      seconds is comfortably above a healthy answer (a few ms;
#                      the route touches SQLite and nothing else) and well below
#                      the 20 s a single `gitSync` may legitimately hold the
#                      loop for.
#   --start-period=180s the first transcript scan re-aggregates the whole
#                      history synchronously and can take a while on a large
#                      one. Failures inside this window do not count towards
#                      `retries`.
#   --interval=30s     often enough that a monitor watching `docker inspect`
#                      learns within a minute or two; rare enough that the probe
#                      itself is not a load.
#   --retries=5        deliberately tolerant: 5 consecutive failures across
#                      30 s intervals is ~2.5 minutes of sustained trouble
#                      before the container is marked unhealthy. The bar is high
#                      because acting on this is destructive — a restart marks
#                      every in-flight run `failed` and leaves the cycle each one
#                      was mid-way through unreconciled, so at 25 concurrent runs
#                      a spurious unhealthy is far more expensive than a slow one.
#
# What this does NOT do is restart the container. Docker Engine surfaces health
# state (`docker inspect`, and `docker ps` shows "(unhealthy)") but does not act
# on it — only Swarm and other orchestrators do. Wiring it to a restart is the
# operator's choice: an orchestrator's own policy, or a supervisor watching
# `docker inspect --format '{{.State.Health.Status}}'`. Given how expensive a
